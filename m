RCU is good for adding list entries, deleting list entries, and updating
the value(s) of a list element.

RCU is not good for excluding readers of a data structure while multiple
entries are being added, deleted, and/or modified, such that the readers
only see the state of the data structure either (1) before any changes
or (2) after all changes occur.  Overlay application and removal require
multiple modifications, with readers seeing either the before state of
the after state.

Agreed.

The current implementation allows and properly handles misses.  But misses
will not occur if the range of phandle values is in the range of 1..n,
when there are n distinct phandle values.

I don't think the patch makes the implementation so bad that the cache
should instead switch to a fixed size to avoid kcalloc().
