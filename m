I will take a look at this later this week. That said, I am unable be
gauge the urgency based on you ping here. You have shown the same urgency
last time for a feature that I queued promptly just to know that it was
abandon within couple of days. So I don't want to rush here simply based
on the number of pings here. I need to understand that it is really that
important. For now, I am thinking of skipping even v6.7 just to allow
some time for Qcom to make up its mind and be absolutely sure this is what
they *really* want this time.
