The SiFive Test device has only one register at offset 0x0 and three
possible magic values (0x3333, 0x5555, and 0x7777).

The SYSCON based Reboot and Poweroff driver do exactly the same
thing what Christop's virt machine poweroff driver does so we are not
doing "random register writes" via DT.

In fact, using SYSCON based Reboot and Poweroff we are actually
describing the Reboot and Poweroff mechanism directly in DT without
adding a complete driver for just one register write. This means we
are totally aligned with "DT doctrine" and over here we going one-step
more by describing Reboot and Poweroff mechanism in DT.

A quick GREP shows that the SYSCON Reboot and Poweroff drivers
are quite widely used in ARM, ARM64 and MIPS architectures. Some of
the  SOCs using these drivers are: Samsung Exynos, HiSilicon Hi3660,
HiSilicon Hi6220, Rockchip RK3xxx, AppliedMicro XGene, Broadcom
BCM33xx, Broadcom BCM63xx, etc. Majority of ARM/ARM64 SOCs
these days use the PSCI based SYSTEM RESET and SHUTDOWN
methods so we might not see more Reboot and Poweroff drivers for
ARM world.

IMHO, we should definitely avoid adding a driver to Linux when there
a generic driver already available. This helps in kernel maintenance
in long-term.
