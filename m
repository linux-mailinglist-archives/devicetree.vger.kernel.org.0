As far as I'm concerned and only talking about the drivers, I would 
prefer that we keep the following config options activated in the .config:

CONFIG_VIDEO_ATMEL_ISI=m
CONFIG_DRM_PANEL_SIMPLE=y
CONFIG_FB_ATMEL=y
CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_ATMEL_LCDC=y

The question to know if they are activated by default or not and if the 
associated stack is selected or not, well... I lost track of this, sorry.

Regards,
   Nicolas
