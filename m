Actually I do have DDEBUG set all the time when testing this code. The 
entire log is captured into a file that I can search for issues when 
they come.

I'm too lazy to bother about dynamic printk for now. That is nice when 
debugging a deployed solution where you don't want to skew runtime 
timings too much, but I'm not at the point of doing performance 
measurements yet.

Anyway, this one has crossed the distraction threshold too at this point 
so I'll remove it.

In this case I can agree to that. Will do.

Here I disagree. You just can't return and let the system go any longer 
if some stray DMA is not stopped, period. No compromize is possible 
here.

When/if that happens, it is not very difficult to realign the other 
assignments. I don't think it is likely that adding/removing fields here 
will ever become an area of conflicting patch contention. OTOH this 
makes for easier code reading whose occurence is more likely.

Oh nice! Didn't know about that.

Looks like %*ph is what I want here.

No problem, will do.
