For the OMAP mailboxes, we do not want to enable just the cluster. A
cluster without any enabled sub-mailboxes or interrupts will fail the probe.

There are 12 clusters but we won't be enabling all clusters for the MPU
core running Linux. There are some clusters that are dedicated to
RTOS-to-RTOS IPC which we don't want to even probe on Linux. This patch
adds all the clusters, and the next patch enables only the clusters used
by Linux that have the proper sub-mailboxes and interrupts. Please see
the NOTE above for the reason why not all the 4 interrupts from each
cluster are added here.

regards
Suman
