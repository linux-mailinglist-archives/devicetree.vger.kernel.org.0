I'd expect some refactoring here with existing backlight schemas
including the ones I just added for 5.9.

Ideally, we shouldn't have any property have a type definition more
than once. (We don't have any way to detect that though it wouldn't be
hard to write a program to do so).

Needs a type.

It's an unsigned int, so the min is already 0.
