Hi Laurent, thanks for the thorough review. Some comments below:

Ok.

example-schema.yaml says that

    Vendor specific properties have slightly different schema
    requirements than common properties. They must have at least a type
    definition and 'description'.

However, dt_binding_check doesn't seem to enforce this rule for string
properties, and I saw a couple of vendor-specific string properties in
other bindings that don't define the type either, so I'm going to follow
your suggestion but only for string properties, the rest need a type
definition.

I noticed I can remove the "allOf" keywords from these too.

You're completely right.

Ok.

I think it's required here, removing it makes the test fail.

Good question. The original binding is not completely clear on
this. There's a "Required properties" section at the top that doesn't
include the supplies, the supplies block for the ADV7511/11w/13 looks
like a gray area in that regard, while the same block for ADV7533/35 is
more explicit in that they are required, and they are not listed in the
"Optional properties" section.

However, most of the DTs that use this binding don't define any
supplies. And AFAICT from looking at the code, regulator_get() will use
a dummy regulator and show a warning for every expected regulator that's
not defined in the DT.

If we want to be more strict and require the definition of all the
supplies, there will be many more DTs changes in the series, and I'm not
sure I'll be able to do that in a reasonable amount of time. I'm looking
at them and it's not always clear which regulators to use or if they are
even defined.

Oops, thanks for catching these.

Cheers,
