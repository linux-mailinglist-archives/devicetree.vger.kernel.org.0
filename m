I started with a per-erratum identifier, but there are 8 of them, and its hard to know
where to put it. The CPU side is detectable from the MIDR,its an interconnect property
that we need to know ... but the interconnect isn't described in the DT. (but the obvious
compatible string identifies the PMU)

A DT property was explicitly requested by Marc Z on the RFC:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/86mt5dxxbc.wl-maz@kernel.org/

The concern is that platforms where the CPU is affected, but the issue is masked by the
interconnect will never bother with a firmware interface. The kernel can't know this, so
has to enable the workaround at the cost of performance.

Adding a DT property to describe the hardware state of the erratum avoids the need for
separate kernel builds to work around the missing firmware.

The firmware interface has to exist for ACPI systems where EL3 can't influence the ACPI
tables, which typically get replaced if the part is OEM'd.

Ultimately all the interface is describing is a non-discoverable hardware property
relevant to an erratum. These are often configurations the silicon manufacturer chooses.
In this case its the behaviour of the interconnect.

If we didn't have to support ACPI systems, this stuff would only have been in the DT. With

I do need this early in the boot, but I'm not worried about the delay as these tables
should be small.

At a guess, its all mobile phones produced in the last 2 years that want to run a version
of Android that uses virtualisation. Cortex-A78 is affected, but I don't know when the
first products were shipped.



Thanks,
