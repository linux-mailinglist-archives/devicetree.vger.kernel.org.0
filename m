Hello,

 I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm single and lonely in this busy part of
the world and I need attention, an affectionate and romantic companion. I
hope we can be friends as I would love to be in constant communication
with you and would like to explore the opportunity to learn more about
each other. I will really appreciate if you could reach out to a lonely
heart that needs a companion. I will be happy to hear from you.

hugs and kisses,
Jo
