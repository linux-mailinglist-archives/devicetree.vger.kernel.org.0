Thanks for checking.

In the meantime, I realized that the CM4S is 2711-based and, according
to the downstream DT, multiplexes I2C0 on pins 28+29, not 44+45 :-(
Umang and Kieran also told me that we want to test camera support on the
Pi 3B. It looks like the only viable approach to support all that will
be to include per-board I2C0 pinmux .dtsi as done in the downstream
kernel. I'll send a v5.

I'll update the compatible string, it's an easy change and it's nice to
be accurate.
