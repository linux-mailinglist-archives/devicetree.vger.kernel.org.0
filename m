Subject: [PATCH v3 11/16] drm/panel-simple-edp: Split the delay structure out
Date:   Wed,  1 Sep 2021 13:19:29 -0700
Message-Id: <20210901131531.v3.11.I24f3646dd09954958645cc05c538909f169bf362@changeid>

In the case where we can read an EDID for a panel the only part of the
panel description that can't be found directly from the EDID is the
description of the delays. Let's break the delay structure out so that
we can specify just the delays for panels that are detected by EDID.

This is simple code motion. No functional change is intended.

Changes in v3:
- Split the delay structure out patch just on eDP now.
