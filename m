Dear,

Permit me to introduce myself to you, I am Mrs. Deborah Kouassi, am
the regional bank manager of Bank Of Africa C=C3=B4te d'Ivoire.

As the regional bank manager of BOA, it's my duty to send a financial
report to our head office at the end of each year but in year 2017
report, i discovered an excess profits of seventeen million united
states dollar which i have kept in suspense account without any
beneficiary.

That is why am contacting you for us to work together to get the said
fund transfer to your bank account and the percentage ratio is forty
percent for you and sixty percent for me.

All i need from you is to stand as the depositor next of kin, so that
our bank head office will order the transfer to your designated bank
account.

If you accept this offer to work with me, if you find this proposal
suitable for you, kindly reply your full details. I will appreciate it
very much if this proposal is acceptable by you but do not take undue
advantage of the trust I have bestowed on you and I assure you that we
shall achieve it successfully.

Yours sincerely.

Mrs. Deborah Kouassi.
