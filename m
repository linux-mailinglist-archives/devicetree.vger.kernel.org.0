Greetings,

Greetings to you and your family.

My name is Mr. Kone Compaore, the auditing general with the bank,
Africa Develop bank (ADB) Ouagadougou, Burkina

Faso, in West Africa. I am contacting you to seek your honesty and
sincere cooperation in confidential manner to

transfer the sum of 10.5 (Ten million five hundred thousand Dollars)
to your existing or new bank account.

This money belongs to one of our bank client, a Libyan oil exporter
who was working with the former Libyan

government; I learn t that he was killed by the revolutionary forces
since October 2011. Our bank is planning to

transfer this entire fund into the government public treasury as
unclaimed fund if nobody comes to claim the money

from our bank after four years without account activities .

What the bank need is proof and information about the late customer
which I will assist you on. This is a genuine,

risk free and legal business transaction, All details shall be sent to
you once I hear from you.

The information as contained herein be accorded the necessary
attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it

deserves.

If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and
confidentiality reply back to me urgently for more

details

Best regards,
Kone Compaore
