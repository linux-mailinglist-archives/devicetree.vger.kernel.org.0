Thank you for doing the tests.  Actual data helps a lot.

If there is only a 10% collision rate for this case, that does not
sound bad to me.  There is the possibility of current or future
code resulting in ping ponging between two phandle values which
collide in the cache, but that should not be the common case.

However, given a choice between two algorithms, one of which
guarantees no thrashing (the current cache algorithm) and one
which allows a pathologic use case which results in thrashing,
I prefer the first algorithm.  This may seem theoretical, but
I have seen enough pathological code paths in my years of
performance analysis and tuning to be sensitive to this issue.

Yes, you stated that in a more general way than I did.  Agreed.

I also agree with that.  I threw that out as kind of a nuclear option.
If ppc did not benefit from the cache having been implemented and
perceived a negative impact from the cache, this is simply a way
to remove that negative impact.  Then ppc would be in the same
state as before we implemented the cache.  Again, I also do not
like such a special casing.

I could be convinced to go to a one time sized cache, especially now
that the RT issue exists.  If we change to that, it would be documented
as a possible overhead impact that devicetree overlays would have to
accept.
