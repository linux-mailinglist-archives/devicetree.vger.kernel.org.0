Hi all,

At long last, here's an initial cut of the CMN PMU driver that's been
festering in on-and-off development for years. It should be functionally
complete now, although there is still scope for improving the current
implementation (e.g. watchpoint register allocation could be cleverer).

Of particular interest at this point is the user interface - is it
sufficiently complete and useful? Is there any need for a third event
targeting method in between "single node ID" and "all nodes"? Is it
worth templating watchpoints by port and channel to mimic XP events? Do
we want to expose watchpoint-based bandwidth events as synthetic per-node
events? Not all of that would need to be implemented right now so as to
further stall upstreaming, but I really want to make sure that the initial
interface is solid and any further enhancements can cleanly extend it,
rather than painting ourselves into a corner in terms of ABI support.

Robin.
