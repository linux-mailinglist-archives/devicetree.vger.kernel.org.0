Hi All,

This is a replacement series for an earlier attempt by me for this
from quite a while ago:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11199517/

As discussed there, this series implements an altmodes devicetree-fwnode
under the usb-connector node which has 1 child-node per supported
altmode and in that child-node the svid and vdo for the supported
altmode are specified.

Note this patch-set does not contain any devicetree users of the
new bindings. The new support/binding is used on X86 Cherry Trail
devices with a fusb302 Type-C controller (special variant of the
INT33FE device in ACPI). But this patch should also help getting
Display Port altmode to work with the mainline kernel on boards
like the Pine RockPro64 and Pinebook Pro, which is why I've added
Tobias Schramm to the Cc since he has done mainline devicetree
work for the Pinebook Pro in the past.

The 1st patch adds the dt-bindings docs. I'm not sure if this one
should go upstream through the USB tree together with patches 2-3 or
if this should go upstream separately, Rob ?

Patches 2-3 add support for the new binding to Type-C controller drivers
using the tcpm framework, such as the fusb302 driver.

Patch 4 uses swnodes to add the altmode info on the earlier mentioned
X86 CHT devices, making DP-altmode work there for the first time.

Regards,

Hans
