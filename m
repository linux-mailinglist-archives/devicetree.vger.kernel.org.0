This required schema only applies to the trig-conns@ child nodes. So
each trig-conns can have one only of the three attributes - as each
trig-conns node represents a single connection between the CTI and a
component, and defines the trigger signals that exist in that
connections.

At the cti@ level, if the compatible is the arm,coresight-cti-v8-arch
type, then both cpu and arm,cs-dev-assoc can appear at this level as
we only need to know the devices it is connected to - the individual
trigger signals in the connections are defined by the architecture and
do not need repeating here.

Thanks -  the W=12 starts outputting warnings for lack of reg in child nodes.
I'll build the requirement into the next version so it is explicitly
called out in the check.

I was referring to the requirement for reg = <N> in node@<N> child
nodes - though I have now spotted this in the early part of the
0.3-rc2 spec - which appears to be the latest I have access to.

So I can add in the reg<> parameters and fix this up.
