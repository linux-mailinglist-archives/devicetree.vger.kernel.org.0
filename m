It was somewhat scripted at least...

I'm saying a bunch of these could just be a single schema doc with a
long list of compatibles. The variation is in what properties are
required or not.

This means 'compatible' must have 2 strings in the order specified.

This means 'compatible' is a single string of one of the above.

Exactly.

Okay.

These are all DSI panels. Linus' DSI controller binding defines what
'reg' is, so I prefer not duplicating that everywhere.

That's partly what my comment above on 'backlight' was about. I don't
really know what's just copy-n-paste inconsistencies vs. actual h/w
differences.

I just maintained what was documented before and haven't checked each
one against usage in in-tree dts files. This is why I've tried to
enforce that folks list which 'simple panel' properties they use.

For example, there's 3 cases for a panel with 'enable-gpios':
- No enable input
- Enable input line is tied off to active state
- Enable input line is connected to GPIO

What's written for the binding probably depends on the board design
the person writing the binding is using. Arguably, 'enable-gpios'
should always be optional because of the 2nd case unless the h/w
always needs s/w control of the enable line.

It's not because the example starts failing when the schema validates
it. I can split it out though if you prefer.
