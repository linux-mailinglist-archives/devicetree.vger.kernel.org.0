Jon says:

"It was changes to the mmc power handling.  Basically telling the
controller that the card should be able to wake it up from a sleep
state.

"I think it has to do with the runtime PM addition.  This was added
to the TI driver in commit, 9b71578de08748defb3bcae3ce8ed1a75cb6a8d7
I don't know if that is what broke it, but that was the initial
integration.

"That was added after changes to the MMC layer were done I believe."

Jon thinks the idea for fixing it came from a post on one of the
mailing lists, but is unable to find it now.

So, I think the cause is now lost in the mists of time.
