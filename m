Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] Convert adi,adv7511.txt DT bindings to yaml

Hi,

This series convert the adi,adv7511.txt DT bindings to json-schema. As a
result of the conversion some dts files needed to be updated.

The changes to the dts files are of three types:

  - Reordering of the I2C slave addresses list of the ADV75xx node. The
    addresses in the 'reg' property and the matching names in
    'reg-names' for an I2C slave don't need to be in any particular
    order, but the DT schema defines these properties as a cell array
    and a string array respectively, which are ordered, so the
    definitions in the dts files must match the order in the binding.

  - Filling the minimum binding requirements. Most of the time this
    means creating a 'ports' node in the boards that don't define
    them. Note, however, that the purpose of this is simply to make the
    definition compliant with the binding. I didn't define any endpoints
    for the ports.

  - Removing unneeded properties.

About the binding conversion:

  - The original binding covered five different devices: ADV7511,
    ADV7511W, ADV7513, ADV7533 and ADV7535. They all share a common set
    of properties but ADV7533 and ADV7535 have enough differences from
    the rest to warrant their own binding file. In v1 I modelled all the
    properties constraints for all five devices in a single file but it
    turned out a bit too complex. Splitting the binding into one for
    ADV7511/11W/13 and another for ADV7533/35 makes them much easier to
    read and maintain.

Patches 1/6 to 5/6 contain the dts changes. Patch 6/6 contains the
binding conversion.

NOTE: the bindings have been tested with:

  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7511.yaml>
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7511.yaml>

for <arch> = arm and arm64. dts changes haven't been tested in hardware.

Changes in v2:

  - [Rob] adi,adv7511.yaml split into two files: adi,adv7511.yaml and
    adi,adv7533.yaml.

  - [Rob] Remove maxItems from supplies.

  - Additional DTs fixes:
    - iwg20d-q7-dbcm-ca.dtsi
    - r8a7745-iwg22d-sodimm-dbhd-ca.dts
    - r8a7790-lager.dts

    - r8a77970-v3msk.dts
    - r8a77980-condor.dts
    - r8a77980-v3hsk.dts
    - r8a77990-ebisu.dts
