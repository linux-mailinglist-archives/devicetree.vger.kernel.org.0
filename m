Yes. 'Optional' might not be appropriate because all SoCs has the region.

Right, however, it isn't desiable that the description of the region is
changed by extending the driver.

No, there is no other hardware reg between each region.

Surely it seems pointless to divide all tuples individually.
I'll rewrite it to cover entire xdmac reg region.
