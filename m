Hi everyone,

This series add support for MSI's Primo73 tablet. This is a 7" tablet
based on Allwinner's A20 SoC.

The tablet uses some unknown LCD panel, with only serial number
markings, and what appears to be a part number. Searching the Internet
for said part number yielded no usable results. Hence this panel is
described solely using the panel-dpi binding. The display timing values
were retrieved from the hardware description file from the original
Android system.

A new property for the panel-dpi binding is added to describe the color
depth of the panel, which is normally included the panel description in
panel-simple. Otherwise this would be undefined in the panel-dpi case
and left to encoder drivers to make up. I believe this would be separate
from the bus format, which was added earlier and then retracted.

Patches 1 and 2 add the new color depth property to the device tree
binding and the panel-simple driver.

Patch 3 adds the board compatible string to the list of boards.

Patch 4 adds a pinmux option for LCD0 full 24-bit output, with
control signals, for the A20.

Patch 5 adds the device tree file for the Primo73.


Please have a look.


Regards
ChenYu
