All that needs to be sorted out in this set are the comments made by
Maxime.  When you do address those please only resend that patch.
Since Maxime's comments are related to yaml syntax rather than the
bindings themselves, I have added your set to my next tree so that it
can soak in linux-next over the next few weeks.

Thanks,
Mathieu
