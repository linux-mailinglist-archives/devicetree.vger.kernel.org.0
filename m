Hi Arnd,

thanks for having a look. I was a bit unsure about the policy of those
changes, so glad to have the discussion.

Actually this patch is meant to be only about the last past: to sync
multi_v5_defconfig with the output of "make savedefconfig". .config stays
the same. I initially tried to chase down the reason for each line change,
but gave up quickly, because it becomes tedious to learn about this,
especially about symbols that got *removed*. Also Kconfig is somewhat
sensitive, a single "select" or "default" change in one random Kconfig can
affect the result of savedefconfig.

As I noted in the commit message, the .config does *not* change as a result
of this patch, the whole purpose is just to make the next patch clearer.

So I can try find the reason for each removal, if you like, but I am not
sure that's worthwhile? It is my understanding that Kconfig changes tend
to accumulate cruft in the various defconfigs over time. In U-Boot we gave
up on reasoning, and just regularly sync the output of savedefconfig over
to the *_defconfigs, to keep them minimal and meaningful.

And I found Olof's commit 30b10c77837c ("ARM: defconfig: re-run
savedefconfig on multi_v* configs") as a precedence for this kind of cleanup.

Yes, I understand. Is there some policy here, for instance to keep
those in, for clarity?

It's not in the current .config. From what I can see, it depends on
ARCH_AMBA, which is selected by ARCH_NOMADIK, but that one is not enabled
by multi_v5_defconfig. Not sure if that is an oversight, or a change, a
the dependency is bogus, or something else.

If you find that useful, I can try to find those dependency chains for the
other options, but I definitely lack the knowledge about the history of
those old platforms, so I can't reason about them. But I could present you
the findings and you can then say what to do?

As I mentioned, the .config didn't change at all, so those options are
already not included in mainline anymore.

AFAICS, those last options depend on CONFIG_FB, which isn't enabled. Is
that a regression due to the recent fbdev changes?

Cheers,
Andre
