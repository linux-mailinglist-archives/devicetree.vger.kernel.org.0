Yes, I believe so, as long as one can use cubemx to generate bsp for 
non-ST board which uses that functionality.

Not necessarily, a lot of the cubemx examples do use the same memory 
layout. So making it easy for user to evaluate the CM4 usage is the goal 
here. And that includes non-ST produced boards.

I agree, let's wait for Alex.
