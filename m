Hi Rob, Miles,

Thank you both for your replies.

Unfortunately, the DT is not publicly available yet. Anyway, I
currently have 41 reserved memory regions.

I'm happy with just growing the fixed array size, but just out of

64 would be a safe value for my case as well.

We are also trying to reduce the amount of memory regions, but it's
unlikely we will manage to stay below 32 :/
