Note that the DRM "CMA" helpers are somewhat misnamed, since they're in 
fact based on the common DMA API, and thus transparent IOMMU-backed DMA 
ops will "just work" without the drivers having to care. Since all the 
display components behind the IOMMU will be in the same IOMMU group, 
they're guaranteed to always operate in the same address space as each 
other, so there should be no additional problems with buffer sharing 
(assuming the code doesn't have bugs that it's currently just getting 
away with).

That's also fine - as discussed on the driver thread there's no point 
trying to expose a distinction between devices at the API level, so the 
IDs are really only relevant to the driver internals touching the 
various enable registers (and even then only if you wanted to refine the 
current "just enable everything" approach).
