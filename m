Widespread enough to have at least 2 controllers needing that :P. Any
code sharing is good to take IMO.

True, you can turn that into a TODO. That's still something I'd like to
see shared. That's not to say we have to handle all weird cases in the
core, we can simply add a ->check() hook to the pattern_elem so drivers
can have custom per-element checks.

Sounds good.

Maybe TODO more than FIXME, you're right.
