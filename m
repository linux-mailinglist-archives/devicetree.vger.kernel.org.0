Hi Rob

Sorry I don't understand
	- Who is "2 or 3 users" ?
	- What is "Renesas variant" ?

audio-graph-card2 is based on audio-graph-card,
but different driver not minor variant.
Becase these are different, it can't keep compatibility.
This is the reason why we need audio-graph-card2 instead of expanding
audio-graph-card.

Do you mean you want to merge audio-graph-card and simple-card DT binding ??
audio-graph-card and simple-card are different drivers.

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
