Sir/Madam,

We are registered consultants and financial advisory firm
operating from Bahamas with affiliates partners. We provide High
Net worth discrete financial services globally and what we do is
legal and within the ambient of the law.

We fund projects around the globe. So we are looking for viable
investments and projects that will be vetted to qualify for any
type of funds injection. What is important to us is the viability
of the project and the borrower ability to payback if a loan or
return on Investment if funding a project. Note: We can also fund
projects on equity basis. Both funding procedures requires
collateral and other terms of agreement.

Our core clienteles are people of interest and they do have the
pool of funds to execute the project or loan you want, we have a
huge portfolio that we are able to fund projects from 10M to 1
Billion Dollars at a time. We fund projects around the globe.
What is important to us, is the viability of the project and the
borrower ability for return on investments (ROI) or pay back the
loan and presentation of a collateral.

Note: We can also fund projects on equity basis. These funds can
also be given at a 0% interest and not a loan, rather it will be
given as a tenured operational fund, and the investor is only
interested on any agreed percentage of profit declared, either
quarterly or yearly with the agreed minimum of ROI expected. Both
funding procedures requires collateral.

If you are interested in our service with any of your funding
needs or option, then send us a three page brief summary of the
projects that require funding or begin to let us know your
options or the amount you want

Regards,
Goh L.Huat
Associate Partner
