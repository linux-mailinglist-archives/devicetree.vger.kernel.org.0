Really weird word-wrapping?  You've also indented your whole commit message?

Overall the commit message sounds a lot like the message in commit
85a3d920d30a ("clk: qcom: Add a dummy enable function for GX gdsc").
That's fine for the most part, but it makes it sound like you're
_only_ adding the dummy enable.  In this case you're adding support
for the GX domain and _also_ adding a dummy enable.  Maybe try:

Most of the time the CPU should not be touching the GX domain on the
GPU except for a very special use case when the CPU needs to force the
GX headswitch off. Add the GX domain for that use case.  As part of
this add a dummy enable function for the GX gdsc to simulate success
so that the pm_runtime reference counting is correct.  This matches
what was done in sdm845 in commit 85a3d920d30a ("clk: qcom: Add a
dummy enable function for GX gdsc").

Since you are re-posting Taniya's patch you need to add your own
Signed-off-by as per kernel policy.

nit: technically name could be "gx_gdsc" to match the name of the
struct and #define.  Your name is copied from sdm845 and matches the
name of the struct and #define from there.

Compared to sdm845, you have different flags.  There we have:

.flags = CLAMP_IO | AON_RESET | POLL_CFG_GDSCR,

I'm not sure I have enough background knowledge about the hardare to
figure this out.  Can you confirm that you're different than sdm845 on
purpose?  Bonus points if you can confirm whether sdm845 is also
correct as it is today or should be changed to match what you have?

Assuming that the question on flags is resolved and the commit message
updated, feel free to add my Reviewed-by tag.
