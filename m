So for my own understanding, the problem here is that things want to
vote for interconnect bandwidth within a specific RSC context? Where
normally the RSC context is simply "Apps@EL1", we might also have
"Apps@EL3" for trustzone, or in the case we're coding for,
"display-specific RSC context". I guess this context might stay on
even if Apps@EL1 votes are entirely discounted or off? So then would
there be an additional interconnect provider for "display context RSC"
next to apps_bcm_voter? Would that expose all the same nodes as
apps_bcm_voter, or a different set of nodes?

Assuming it's exposing some of the same nodes as apps_bcm_voter, the
other way to do this would be increasing #interconnect-cells, and
putting the RSC context there. Did you choose not to go that way
because nearly all the clients would end up specifying the same thing
of "Apps@EL1"?
