Yes, it seems it is not hanging anymore and that is always a good thing :-).
For me the pci phy driver is ready to be mainlined if the two phys
approach is correct.
and for the pci controller part I need to review how interrupts are
being mapped and
then convert bindings into a yaml file and get feedback about what to
do with the clock stuff.
According to this thread and because there is not a clock plan for
mt7621 assumptions should not be done for peripherals clocks:

http://archive.lwn.net:8080/devicetree/20190724022310.28010-1-gch981213@gmail.com/

So maybe we can just forget about clocks and clock-names stuff in the
pci controller binding and do what we are doing with the clock gate
now which is setting up the bit manually as other similar drivers do.

What do you think? (your tree has the patches of the thread I am
pointed out here applied)

This one is not applied to the tree. This should be do throug the
MAINTAINERS file. Will do when this is mainlined.
