Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] dt-bindings: display: ti,tfp410.txt: convert to yaml

This series converts the DT binding documentation for the TI TFP410
DPI-to-DVI encoder to json-schema.

Some minor changes were made to two DTs in order to make them compliant
with the binding. These changes shouldn't have any functional effect.

This also fixes a minor bug in the ti-tfp410 driver that would cause a
wrong calculation of the setup and hold times when the de-skew feature
is enabled. The retrieval of the de-skew value from the DT has also been
updated to reflect the binding changes.

Changes in v2:

  - ti,tfp410.yaml
    - Set license as GPL-2.0-only (Sam Ravnborg)
    - Complete pclk-sample and bus-width comments (Sam)
    - Remove quotes from compatible value (Sam)
    - Remove the allOf keyword from the ti,deskew definition (Sam)
    - Set endpoint as optional in port definitions
    - Set a range for ti,deskew

  DTs fixes (added):
    - dove-sbc-a510.dts: s/powerdown-gpio/powerdown-gpios (Sam)
    - dove-sbc-a510.dts: Add dummy ports node
    - imx53-cx9020.dts: Group the ports in a ports node

  ti-tfp410.c (added):
    - Fix setup time and hold time calculation based on the deskew value
      (Laurent Pinchart)

Ricardo Ca√±uelo (4):
  ARM: dts: dove: Make the DT compliant with the ti,tfp410 binding
  ARM: dts: ims53: Group port definitions for the dvi-converter
  dt-bindings: display: ti,tfp410.txt: convert to yaml
  drm/bridge: tfp410: Fix setup and hold time calculation
