This is a fixed version of the initial post. I dropped the two patches
that were already applied by the respective maintainers, and fixed the
smaller issues mentioned in the review.
This adds v2 of the series enabling the "Lctech Pi F1C200s" board on top,
also with the comments addressed.
The whole series goes on top of v3 of Icenowy's F1C100s USB support
series [1]. There is no real conflict, but the lctech-pi.dts file
references the new USB DT nodes from the .dtsi.

I put a git repo with all those patches up here:
https://github.com/apritzel/linux/commits/f1c100s-devices-v2

For a changelog see below.

=================
The Allwinner F1C100s series of SoCs shares many peripherals with other
Allwinner SoCs. Since they are compatible, we can use the existing
drivers, and just need to enable the devices in the DT.

This series adds the I2C controllers, the PWM device, the CIR (infrared)
device and the LRADC (aka. KEYADC, low res ADC) to the F1C100s .dtsi, so
boards can just use them by setting 'status = "okay";'.

The only thing missing driver-wise is the IR mod clock, which was not
modeled in our CCU driver. Patch 4/10 fixes that.

For every device there is one patch that adds the new compatible string
to the DT binding, and another patch to add the DT node.

This has been tested on the Lctech Pi F1C200s board, by:
- Connecting an LED to PE6, and configuring this as the PWM pin in the DT.
  Doing a sweep on /sys/class/pwm/pwm1/duty_cycle made the LED fade out.
- Configuring PD0/PD12 as I2C0, and letting i2c-detect find the on-board
  NS2009 I2C chip.
- Connecting two resistors to the "ADC" pin, and configuring them as two
  buttons in the DT. /dev/input/event0 properly reported button presses.
- Connecting an infrared receiver to PE11, configured as CIR.
  ir-keytable reported key presses on a remote control.

All those (basic) tests were successful, and prove that the peripherals
do work and are compatible.

The final three patches add the binding docs and the .dts file for the
Lctech Pi F1C200s development board.

Please have a look and test on your hardware, if possible.

Cheers,
Andre

- dropped former patch 3/9 and 8/9: already applied
- increase register frame size in DT for PWM and LRADC
- drop I2C1 pins from pinctroller DT node
- increase IR mod clock mux to 2 bits
- fix mistyped comma in vendor prefix name
- drop unneeded mmc0 and spi0 aliases from Lctech Pi DT
- add /omit-if-no-ref/ tag to UART1 pins
- add ACKs and Reviewed-by tags
