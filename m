That comment was made in November 2021.  The recently ratified list 
<https://wiki.riscv.org/display/HOME/Recently+Ratified+Extensions> has a 
bunch in November that I'm going to skip, but since then there's been:

* Zmmul: ratified at version 2.0
* Zawrs: ratified at version 1.01
* Ztso: ratified at version 1.0
* RV32E/RV64E: ratified at version 2.0
* Zicntr: ratified without a version
* Zihpm: ratified without a version
* Zc*: ratified at version 1.0 (which is newer than v1.0.1, v1.0.2, 
  v1.0.3, and v1.0.3-1).

So I think it doesn't really matter what some comment in a github issues 
says, there's still no consistent versioning scheme for the extensions.
