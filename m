Well, the current form of the YAML bindings require every combination of
compatible strings to be listed, either explicitly, or using an list of
allowed strings for each position. This combination here is not listed
at the moment.

OK, thanks for the confirmation, and I agree. I will ditch this patch
and replace it with a respective bindings fix.

Thanks,
Andre.
