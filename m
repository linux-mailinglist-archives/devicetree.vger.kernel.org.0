Drop the last '-'. It should be a list of 2 entries with min/max being a 
single schema.

Use generic node names. 'ahb' or 'axi' is also allowed if that matches 
the bus type.

This is at the wrong level and defines 'compatible' as a node with 
property 'compatible' having a value of 'simple-bus'. This should be 
under 'smb@...' with an 'allOf'.
