Hello Dear,

Am Mrs. Maya H. Oliver I know that this message will be a surprise to
you. Firstly, I am married to Mr. Patrick Oliver, A gold merchant who
owns a small gold mine in Burkina Faso; He died of Cardiovascular
Disease in mid-March 2011. During his lifetime, he deposited the sum
of Eight million, Five hundred thousand Euros. in a bank in
Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in West Africa. The
deposited money was from the sale of the shares, death benefits
payment and entitlements of my deceased husband by his company.

I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in
good health since I am not in good health condition in which I sleep
every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I
am suffering from long time cancer and presently I am partially
suffering from a stroke illness which has become almost impossible for
me to move around. I need your urgent answer to know if you will be
able to execute this project, and I will give you more information on
how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.

Thanks
Mrs. Maya H.
