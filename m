Exactly, and because this is a spi driver it should have both, the node name
include the unit-address and the reg property. I.e:

    spi0 {
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        cros-ec@0 {
            compatible = "google,cros-ec-spi";
            reg = <0x0>;
            spi-max-frequency = <5000000>;
        };
    };

Thanks,
 Enric
