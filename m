If nothing else if we're going to land your patch, can you at least
put a comment in there that says "only needed to support legacy device
trees that didn't include "qcom,qusb2-v2-phy" in the compatible
string.  Then the person who adds the next Qualcomm SoC will know not
to add themselves to the table too.

Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole stable ABI argument, but what
you say is the official word.  The bindings are supposed to be a
stable ABI and it's a good goal to strive for.

...but in reality most people are OK with it not being quite so stable
as long as it's not hurting anyone.  What should have happened here is
that the bindings and dts should have landed in one Linux version and
the driver change landed in the next Linux version.  Now we're stuck
with the breakage, though.  :(  In general for "new" architectures
it's considered more OK to break compatibility, though I guess you can
argue whether sdm845 is really new enough.  I guess to get at the meat
of the issue though: if you need a patch to fix your problem anyway,
why not land the patch that doesn't end up chewing extra up extra code
space and providing a bad example for someone to copy?

Now certainly if changing your DTS was an undue burden (like you've
already baked device trees into firmware) there's no question we
should land your patch.  I'm just not sure the lofty goal of "it's
supposed to be a stable ABI so let's add an entry to the table that
nobody will ever care about after the dts change lands" is enough of a
reason to land it now.

OK, I'll duck from the tomatoes now.
