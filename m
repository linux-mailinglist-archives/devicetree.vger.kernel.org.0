Hmm, I think I looked at leds/ when I wrote that comment about
common.yaml.

Please consider Rob's comment in commit: 44e1655a444fe7a1bd81994d34c6bbb5245b9e60
("dt-bindings: backlight: Convert common backlight bindings to DT

Rob did not see the need for a common binding - but that may change as
we add more backlight bindings.
