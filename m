The numbers looks alright, just one thing below:

The A20 does not have a reset control for the MMC controllers. It looks
like the Linux driver is fine with this (it always tries to get a reset
control, but treats it as optional), and the binding makes it optional for
all compatibles.
I just wonder if that would need to be strengthened in the binding? At the
cost of dropping the sun7i-a20-mmc fallback here? Or do we keep at least
the A20 supporting both, so that existing kernel can support this device?
Or do we not care and just keep the reset control deliberately optional
for all SoCs?

The other bits check out when compared to the manual, though the
full compatibility to the A20 is more a less an assumption at this point.
At least the clock story seems to match (non-calibrate, extra sample
clocks).

Cheers,
Andre
