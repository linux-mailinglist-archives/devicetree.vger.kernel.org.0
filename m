Hi Rob, thanks for taking the time to review the patch. Some comments

I'm not sure I understand what you mean, but dt_binding_check doesn't
say anything about adi,input-style and adi,input-justification being
required when adi,input-colorspace and adi,input-clock are not present.

I think I covered every possible case wrt those properties when running
dt_binding_check and I got the results I was looking for:

- When compatible is either "adi,adv7533" or "adi,adv7535",
  adi,input-colorspace and adi,input-clock aren't required

- For any of the other compatible strings, adi,input-colorspace and
  adi,input-clock are required.

- When adi,input-colorspace and adi,input-clock are defined and they are
  different than "rgb 1x" or "yuv444 1x", adi,input-style and
  adi,input-justification are required.

There's an issue I can't figure out, though. adi,input-colorspace and
adi,input-clock are defined only for devices other than "adi,adv7533"
and "adi,adv7535", but a DT for one of these devices can use those
properties and the binding check won't complain. Moreover, it will check
the above condition even if it doesn't make sense for them (ie. it may
complain that adi,input-style and adi,input-justification are required
even if they aren't defined for "adi,adv7533" and "adi,adv7535").

I think it's a minor issue, but do you know if there's a way to model
that? Are properties always unconditionally defined?

Cheers,
Ricardo
