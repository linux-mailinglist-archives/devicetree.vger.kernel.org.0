This uses only the ramoops "backend" in pstore, so no filesystems are involved.
If I remember correctly, ramoops in the kernel just discards any data that is
too corrupted to process. Barebox should behave the same, as the code was ported
from the kernel.

For passing logs "forward" to the next step in the boot chain, this should work
as well and could be more explicit than the ramoops console. One benefit would
be that keeping the logs from each step separate, right?

ramoops has additional mechanisms to deal with the possible corruption caused by
the crash or reset cycle, which shouldn't be needed in to "forward" direction.

ramoops console is just unstructured text, Linux and Barebox just write
characters to it. More structure might be nice some cases, but the necessary
coordination between different projects could be a high barrier. ;)

Perhaps a simple list of text blocks would be enough, though.

Looking at the proposed schema, I'd prefer to drop the boot-phase and project
patterns and use the lists as suggestions only. The order of /chosen/logs/log@N
should be enough to make sense of those.

Also to keep it simple, perhaps support the memory reference only, and drop the
in-DTB string?

Jan
