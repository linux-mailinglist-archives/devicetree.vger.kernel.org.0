Another related question. I just realized why you probably haven't set
.pwrreg_nopower for the variant_stm32_sdmmc and variant_stm32_sdmmcv2.

I guess it's because you need a slightly different way to restore the
context of MMCIPOWER register at ->runtime_resume(), rather than just
re-writing it with the saved register values. Is this something that
you are looking into as well?
