Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Fix checker warnings related to cros-ec binding

This series fixes a bunch of warnings related to the google,cros-ec
binding, originally reported by Rob Herring.
The patches involve adding missing subnode definitions in the
google,cros-ec binding and the conversion of two existing bindings to
json-schema.

All the related warnings should be fixed after applying the patches,
except for a couple of warnings in the device trees of Qualcomm's
Trogdor and Cheza chromebooks. They define a pdupdate subnode inside
cros-ec that has no binding, the development of drivers and support for
these chromebooks is ongoing and not completely upstreamed yet.

Bindings tested with:

  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=...
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=...

for <arch> = arm and arm64.

Kind regards,
Ricardo
