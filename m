@Mark, I was planning to post v3 patchset series for this and keep yaml 
change as

last patch in the series as suggested. However, we have one update in 
the driver to

support another compatible string. If we keep Documentation change at 
the last, the

driver change will have checkpatch errors. Can you please suggest if 
should make

first Documentation change in text file itself before driver change and 
finally have a

patch to convert it to yaml at the end?


Thanks,

Rohit
