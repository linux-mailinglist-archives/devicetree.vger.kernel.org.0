That means that when you deploy images this property doesn't need to be the=
re
and then your firmware (in our case u-boot) can fill this property
based on your logic.
I definitely want to avoid cases where we would need to maintain
different DTs for
different mode which would bring more overhead.

We should document these u-boot properties in the u-boot project for sure.
But there could also be the reason to do it in Linux because likely
these properties
will get to Linux dtses. Would be good to get some feedback on this.
And if we should
document it in Linux, path and name suggestions would be welcome.

That's not a problem I will figure out.
