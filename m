There are different data mappings defined for LVDS, we should follow
them. lvds666 is wrong in any case, and doesn't apply to a DPI panel
anyway.

I don't like the name data-mapping much for DPI panels I'm afraid. It
made sense for LVDS as it's really about how the different data bits are
mapped to LVDS time slots, but for DPI, what we need to describe is the
format. I also wonder whether multiple formats wouldn't be required when
the panel supports more than one, but that may not apply to panels
covered by these bindings.

If a panel expects RGB888 and receives RGB666 with the two LSBs of each
component hardwired to GND on the PCB, should DT report RGB888 or RGB666
on the panel side ? I'm tempted by the former, and specifying the latter
on the transmitting side.

Please also note that this case is already described by
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt through two
entirely different properties, bus-width and data-shift. I think we
should try to standardize mappings between display and capture. This new
property should be reconsidered in my opinion, I think it was merged too
soon.
