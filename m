Hi Miquel,

> Armada CP110 have a COMPHY IP which supports configuring SERDES lanes
> in one mode, either:
> - SATA
> - USB3 host
> - PCIe (several width)
> - Ethernet (several modes)
>
> As of today, only a few Ethernet modes are supported and the code is
> embedded in the Linux driver. A more complete COMPHY driver that can
> be used by both Linux and U-Boot is embedded in the firmware and can
> be run through SMC calls.
>
> First the current COMPHY driver is updated to use SMC calls but
> fallbacks to the already existing functions if the firmware is not
> up-to-date. Then, more Ethernet modes are added (through SMC calls
> only). SATA, USB3H and PCIe modes are also supported one by one.
>
> There is one subtle difference with the PCIe functions: we must tell
> the firmware the number of lanes to configure (x1, x2 or x4). This
> parameter depends on the number of entries in the 'phys' property
> describing the PCIe PHY. We use the "submode" parameter of the generic
> PHY API to carry this value. The Armada-8k PCIe driver has been
> updated to follow this idea and this change has been merged already:
> http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1072763/

> Changes since v2:
> -----------------
> * Inverted two arguments in a trace.
> * Avoid warning the user when EPROBE_DEFER is returned (clocks case).
> * Added Maxime C. and Grzegorz J. 's Tested-by tags (only on the
>   "introducing SMC calls" patch, but they tested the whole series).
> * Added Rob's Reviewed-by on the bindings.
> * Also updated the bindings as suggested by Rob to reflect that there
>   can be from one to four PHYs in the PCIe nodes (hence, the need for
>   the phy-names property).
>
> Changes since v1:
> -----------------
> * All modes report their errors to the user.
> * If the firmware is too old, advise the user to update it.
> * Credit Grzegorz for his work.
> * Fix wrong speed in Ethernet modes.
> * Add COMPHY necessary clocks.
> * Update bindings.
> * The security flaw related to the fact that we must give the CP
>   address to the firmware has been mitigated by the addition of extra
>   checks in ATF recently.
