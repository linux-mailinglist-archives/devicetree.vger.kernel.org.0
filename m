I am not talking about dropping the A15 GIC. I'm saying that both should
stay. Is there anything in the DT binding that forbids multiple names in
the compatible property?

I'd say that if the binding forbids multiple compatible strings, the
binding is likely to be wrong. We should fix it, and not make the DTs
worse as a result of a binding issue.
