Subject: [PATCH v2 00/19] Enhance CP110 COMPHY support
Date:   Thu, 27 Jun 2019 11:50:45 +0200

Armada CP110 have a COMPHY IP which supports configuring SERDES lanes
in one mode, either:
- SATA
- USB3 host
- PCIe (several width)
- Ethernet (several modes)

As of today, only a few Ethernet modes are supported and the code is
embedded in the Linux driver. A more complete COMPHY driver that can
be used by both Linux and U-Boot is embedded in the firmware and can
be run through SMC calls.

First the current COMPHY driver is updated to use SMC calls but
fallbacks to the already existing functions if the firmware is not
up-to-date. Then, more Ethernet modes are added (through SMC calls
only). SATA, USB3H and PCIe modes are also supported one by one.

There is one subtle difference with the PCIe functions: we must tell
the firmware the number of lanes to configure (x1, x2 or x4). This
parameter depends on the number of entries in the 'phys' property
describing the PCIe PHY. We use the "submode" parameter of the generic
PHY API to carry this value. The Armada-8k PCIe driver has been
updated to follow this idea and this change has been merged already:

Thanks,

Changes since v1:
-----------------
- All modes report their errors to the user.
- If the firmware is too old, advise the user to update it.
- Credit Grzegorz for his work.
- Fix wrong speed in Ethernet modes.
- Add COMPHY necessary clocks.
- Update bindings.
- The security flaw related to the fact that we must give the CP
  address to the firmware has been mitigated by the addition of extra
  checks in ATF recently.
