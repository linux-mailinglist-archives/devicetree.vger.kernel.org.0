Do you have a suggestion on how to do this? If we decouple the two
tasks most of the work would be searching for DTs to fix and finding a
way to fix each one of them, and unless I do this _before_ the binding
conversion I'll get a lot of dtbs_check errors.

The binding conversion itself is done, if we go this route the only
additional change would be to make the supplies required.

Cheers,
Ricardo
