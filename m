Please revert until you can bring in sufficient contents for the trees
to still build. arm64 allmodconfig is unhappy:

Per http://arm-soc.lixom.net/buildlogs/next/next-20191217/buildall.arm64.allmodconfig.log.failed:

/build/drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-cti-platform.c:6:10:
fatal error: dt-bindings/arm/coresight-cti-dt.h: No such file or
directory

In this case, I'm guessing it means getting an ack from the DT
maintainers and either apply the patch in your tree, or get them to
apply it to a stable branch that you can also bring in.
