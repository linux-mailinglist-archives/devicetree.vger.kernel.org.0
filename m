The current description is:

- reg: specifies the base physical address and size of a region in
  memory where the grant table should be mapped to, using an
  HYPERVISOR_memory_op hypercall [...]


Although it says "a region" I think that adding multiple ranges would be
fine and shouldn't break backward compatibility.

In addition, the purpose of the region was described as "where the grant
table should be mapped". In other words, it is a safe address range
where the OS can map Xen special pages.

Your proposal is to extend the region to be bigger to allow the OS to
map more Xen special pages. I think it is a natural extension to the
binding, which should be backward compatible.

Rob, I am not sure what is commonly done in these cases. Maybe we just
need an update to the description of the binding? I am also fine with
adding a new compatible string if needed.
