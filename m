Subject: [PATCH v3 0/4] add devicetree for Forlinx FETA40i-C & OKA40i-C

This patch series adds devicetree support for the Forlinx FETA40i-C SoM
and OKA40i-C carrier board/devboard.

The FETA40i-C is an "industrial/automotive" SoM by Forlinx.

SoM specs:
- SoC: R40 or A40i
- PMIC: AXP221S
- RAM: 1GiB/2GiB DDR3 (dual-rank)
- eMMC: 8GB,
- Mates with carrier board via four 80-pin connectors (AXK6F80337YG).

OKA40i-C is a carrier board by the same manufacturer for this SoM,
whose main purpose is as a development board with a variety of
peripherals:

- Power: DC5V barrel or USB OTG or 4.2V Lipo battery
- Video out: HDMI, TV out, LVDS
- WiFi+Bluetooth: RL-UM02WBS-8723BU-V1.2 (802.11 b/g/n, BT V2.1/3.0/4.0)
- Ethernet: 10/100Mbps
- Storage: ÂµSD, fullsize SD, eMMC (on SoM), SATA
- USB: 3 x USB2.0 Host (2 via hub, 1 native), 1 x USB2.0 OTG (micro-B)
- UART: RS232, RS485, 4 3.3v uarts (of which 2 have RTS/CTS)
- Other I/O: SPI x2, TWI, SDIO header, GPIO header, JTAG header
- Mini PCIe slot with sim holder for WLAN modem
- Smart card holder
- RTC (RX8010SJ)
- Two user LEDs
- Three user buttons (via KeyADC).

Of the board features listed above, support for the following has *NOT*
been tested:
- TV out & LVDS
- SATA
- Smart cards
- KeyADC buttons (no support)

The series consists of four patches, the first three of which are mutually
independent (although patch 2 may refuse to apply without patch 1).
The last patch depends on patches 2 and 3.

Changelog:

v2 -> v3:

* add compatible string for the SoM
* move regulators aldo3, dcdc{2,3,5}, eldo{2.3} to the SoM .dtsi


v1 -> v2:

* split patch into series
  * edits to sun8i-r40.dtsi are now in separate patch
* add dt bindings for compatible strings (in separate patch)
* add /omit-if-no-ref/ to the new uart pin nodes
  * preliminary patch adds the keyword to existing nodes for UART0 & UART3
* whitespace fixes as suggested by checkpatch.pl


draft2 -> v1: 

* fix indentation from spaces to tabs;
* remove commented properties and other extraneous comments;
* enable uarts 2,4,5&7 and alias uart3;
* update the user-LED bindings;
* remove mmc1 & add mmc3 binding;
* bring together the max/min microvolts on three regulators;
    * The reported 2.5v value in ALDO2 comes from U-Boot, where apparently
      this is the KConfig default for this regulator. The correct voltage
      is 1.8v.
* remove extraneous `always-on`s from regulators dldo1 and eldo2/3;
* remove reg_dldo3 node entirely.
