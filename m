I was talking about OF.  Phandles are explicitly defined to be opaque
tokens.  If there is an extra meaning to them in flattened device trees,
well, the kernel should then only depend on that there, not for more
general phandles.  Where is this documented btw?

It's an extra memory access and extra code to execute, for not much gain
(if anything).  While with a reasonable hash function it will be good
for everyone.

Are you seriously saying you think this code can run in zero time and
space on most systems?

The point is that this code could be easily beneficial for most (or all)
users, not just those that use dtc-constructed device trees.  It is
completely obvious that having a worse cache hash function results in
many more lookups.  Whether that results in something expressed as
milliseconds on tiny systems or microseconds on bigger systems is
completely beside the point.
