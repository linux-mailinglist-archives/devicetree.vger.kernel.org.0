I guess SDM845 not only has 4 banks but each bank is bigger?  At first
I thought "yeah, 4 banks and 4 * 0x5 = 0x20" except that's not true in
hex.  ;-)

Without having any documentation ,this seems sane to me.  I guess it
doesn't do a whole lot because the driver just reads one register from
this whole space (at 0x0003000c bytes off).  So it's just a cleanup,
or is it needed to actually fix something?

...the fact that there's a status register in the middle of this seems
strange, though.  Your commit message makes it sound as if this range
is describing the size of the cache itself and then I would think that
this was the address range where you could read from the cache memory
directly, but that doesn't seem to mesh in my mind with there being a
status register.  Hrm.  Am I just confused as usual?
