In this case, I think an alias should be used as it's more of just a
shortcut to finding a specific node.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.yaml.

/chosen

For vendor specific things though I would be cautious. If they are
settings for a specific device, then they probably belong in the
device's node. Second, are they really vendor specific? What we don't
want is each vendor doing the same thing in slightly different ways.
