As maintainer I know that I need to skip dts patches, but there is a risk that
I forget to drop them. So my preference is also to have them as a separate
patch series, but it's a preference only. If you *do* send it as a separate series,
then also include the linux-media mailinglist in the CC, that way I do have
the full overview if I need it.
