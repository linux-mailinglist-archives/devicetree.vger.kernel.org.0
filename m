You can skip the runtime PM, so keep your patch almost like it is now
(in respect to Sylwester's comment about __clk_lookup). However now the
Exynos5433 will enable the clk_name twice: here and in
exynos5433_cmu_probe().

If you keep this approach, you need to remove duplicated part in
exynos5433_cmu_probe()...
