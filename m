Hi,

an update to the F1C100 DT update series. I dropped the defconfig
patches for now, there is more to them than it seems, and they warrant a
separate series and discussion. Also I dropped the MMC binding patch
(v1 07/14), since Ulf already applied that.
Other than that this tries to clarify the watchdog clock situation in a
new patch (02/12), and fixes some smaller issues, as pointed out by
Samuel (many thanks for that!).

----------

The Allwinner F1C100 SoC didn't see much love since its initial merge in
2018: the originally submitted .dts files were very basic, and didn't
cover such simple peripherals as MMC and SPI.
On top of that the watchdog compatible string was wrong, leading to a
non-functional watchdog and reset functionality.

This series aims to fix that, after the series MMC and SPI work, and
make dtbs_check comes back clean.
This was tested with mounting a filesystem on /dev/mmcblk0 on a
LicheePi Nano, also with accessing the SPI flash through /dev/mtdblock
and mtd_debug. Reboot and watchdog now also work.

Mainline U-Boot recently gained F1C100 support, and those DT updates are
needed there as well to get full MMC and SPI access.

The series is structured as follows:
- Patches 01/12 and 03/12 fix the watchdog, which allows to properly
  reboot the system.
- Patches 04-07 fix some shortcomings of the existing DT files, to make
  them DT binding compliant.
- Patches 08-09 are Jesse's recent MMC patches, with the comments from
  the last version addressed [1].
- Patches 10-12 add SPI support, to enable access to the SPI flash on
  the LicheePi Nano board.

Cheers,
Andre
