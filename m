So why don't you use the U-Boot provided copy of the DTB? We sync the 
DTs regularly from the kernel repo to the U-Boot repo, and the U-Boot 
build system builds all DTBs with overlay support already.
This also saves you from the hassle to actually find and load the right 
DTB, as it automatically comes as part of the U-Boot binary.
On the U-Boot prompt (or rather in a script) you would then do:
=> fdt move $fdtcontroladdr $fdt_addr_r
=> load <source> $fdtoverlay_addr_r <your_overlay>.dtbo
=> fdt apply $fdtoverlay_addr_r

You could also chime in on this U-Boot patch of mine, that loads and 
applies all .dtbo files found in a given directory:
https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/20230210110213.2531190-1-andre.przywara@arm.com/

Andre
