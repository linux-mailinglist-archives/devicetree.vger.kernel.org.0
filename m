I think that might make more sense and less confusing. I'd rather
leave the processor board dts for more signal and interface hookup
related topics as it is done right now. if we do endup with too many
SoM duplication, then we should consider it's own dtsi

Of course. We are expecting this to be part of rc2, please rebase and
post once the tag is out. next-20200820 has it already, if you want a
pre-look.
