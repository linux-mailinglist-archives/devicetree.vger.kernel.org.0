I saw few other DTs and they all keep interrupt-controller and timer
outside this "soc" node. Timer is sysreg based, so makes sense. GIC has
both sysreg and MMIO components so I was not sure if it's done like that
due to some dependency on how interrupt-parent property is used.
e.g. arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi

I expect even the motherboard IO shouldn't go inside it but again to avoid
churn I kept it inside.

I agree on firmware, clocks, regulators,..etc. I wanted to keep the churn
minimum and it was not completely aligned to the principles you mentioned
above. Anyways it's better to fix it in right manner for next cycle.
