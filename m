Greetings.

Please I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must
apologize for barging this message into your mail =C2=A0box without any
formal introduction due to the urgency and confidentiality of this
business. My name is Mr.Abderazack Zebdani, from Burkina Faso, West
Africa. I =C2=A0work in Bank Of Africa (BOA) as telex manager, please see
this as a confidential message and do not reveal it to another =C2=A0person
and let me know whether you can be of assistance regarding my proposal
below because it is top secret.I am about to retire from active
Banking service to start a new life but I am skeptical to reveal this
particular secret to a =C2=A0stranger. You must assure me that everything
will be handled confidentially because we are not going to suffer
again in life.=C2=A0 It has been 10 years now that most of the greedy
African Politicians used our bank to launder money overseas through
the =C2=A0help of their Political advisers. Most of the funds which they
transferred out of the shores of Africa were gold and oil money =C2=A0that
was supposed to have been used to develop the continent. Their
Political advisers always inflated the amounts before =C2=A0transferring to
foreign accounts, so I also used the opportunity to divert part of the
funds hence I am aware that there is no =C2=A0official trace of how much
was transferred as all the accounts used for such transfers were being
closed after transfer. I =C2=A0acted as the Bank Officer to most of the
politicians and when I discovered that they were using me to succeed
in their =C2=A0greedy act; I also cleaned some of their banking records
from the Bank files and no one cared to ask me because the =C2=A0money was
too much for them to control. They laundered over $5billion Dollars
during the process.

Before I send this message to you, I have already diverted
($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow account belonging to no one =C2=A0in
the bank. The bank is anxious now to know who the beneficiary to the
funds because they have made a lot of profits with =C2=A0the funds. It is
more than Eight years now and most of the politicians are no longer
using our bank to transfer funds =C2=A0overseas. The ($10.5million Dollars)
has been laying waste in our bank and I don=E2=80=99t want to retire from t=
he
bank without =C2=A0transferring the funds to a foreign account to enable me
share the proceeds with the receiver (a foreigner). The money will =C2=A0be
shared 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no one coming to ask you
about the funds because I secured everything. I only want you to
assist me by providing a reliable bank account where the funds can be
transferred.

You are not to face any difficulties or legal implications. If you are
capable of =C2=A0receiving the funds, do let me know to enable me give you
a detailed information on what to do. For me, I have =C2=A0not stolen the
money from anyone because the other people that took the whole money
did not face any problems. This is =C2=A0 my chance to grab my own life
opportunity but you must keep the details of the funds secret to avoid
any leakages as no =C2=A0one in the bank knows about my plans.Please get
back to me if you are interested and capable to handle this project, I
am =C2=A0looking forward to hear from you immediately for further
information.
 KINDLY REPLY TO THIS EMAIL (abderazackzebdani7@gmail.com)
Thanks with my best regards.
Mr.Abderazack Zebdani.

Telex Manager
Bank Of Africa (BOA)
Burkina Faso.
