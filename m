Besides two conflicts that I can fix very easily about missing
of_node_put() calls, you just merged in phy-next this patch:

phy: marvell: phy-mvebu-cp110-comphy: implement RXAUI support

Which totally conflicts with my series while I also add RXAUI support
in patch 5. Please note that even the third version of my series
was contributed before this patch.

There is one difference to note though: in the patch from Matt Peland,
RXAUI support is embedded in the driver while I do SMC calls.

Anyway, would it be possible to change the order of application if
you want both methods in the driver because it will be much easier
to add Matt's patch on top of my series than the opposite. I can
even do it myself if you wish.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
