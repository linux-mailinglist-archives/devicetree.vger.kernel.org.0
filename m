Is that dma-ranges mapping definitely appropriate? My impression from 
skimming the AP manual is that logic module masters would all see SDRAM 
through the 2GB-3GB alias region, independent of how their slaves are 
decoding incoming accesses. Even in the case of peer-to-peer accesses 
between logic modules, I'd imagine that the process of obtaining the 
target address to program would inherently go through the "ranges" 
translation and result in an 'absolute' PA anyway.
