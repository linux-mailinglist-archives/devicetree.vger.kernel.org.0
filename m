Thanks, Andrew for this explanation.

What about when a interrupt pin from a Marvell PHY (level interrupt) is
connected directly to a gpio pin on Marvell SOC (edge only interrupt),
without any GPIO expander?
This is the case on Turris MOX, and in
drivers/pinctrl/mvebu/pinctrl-armada-37xx.c the function
armada_37xx_irq_set_type again supports only edge interrupts.
But in this case I think setting it to EDGE_FALLING should be okay,
should it not? This controller has a special register where interrupt
status is latched...
