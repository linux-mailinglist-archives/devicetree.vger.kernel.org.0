Hi Rob, could you help me/us with Northstar bindings design, please?

"simple-bus" apparently is a no-way as some single registers may need to
be referenced using syscon.

Here I tried "syscon", "simple-mfd" which lets me:
1. Have subnodes for all small hardware subblocks
2. Reference single registers using syscon
but it appears I can't mix those two.
