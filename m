Probably the mailing list didn't see them.  You responded with HTML
mail.  Please be careful to only respond in plain text.

If they are targeting the same type of hardware IP block then, in the
very least, the bindings need to be the same.  The bindings are
supposed to be describing the hardware.

Presumably if the underlying hardware is the same you should be able
to write one driver and it can just operate in some sort of
"read-only" mode if it's running somewhere it doesn't have access
permissions to actually change the fuses.
