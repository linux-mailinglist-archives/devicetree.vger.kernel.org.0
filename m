Your series has been badly created, strangely I received twice patch 1
with two different contents, patch 2 arrived way later than patch 1 and
3 and the commit title of the bindings patch is wrong, it should
besomething like:

	dt-bindings: mtd: Describe Rockchip RK3xxx NAND flash controller

Can you please resend this series in a v2?

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
