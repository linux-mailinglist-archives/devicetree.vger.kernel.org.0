No, no memory issue led to this thread. I was just testing my patch and
I assumed that I did something wrong in the counting/lock drop/lock
acquire/allocate path because the array was hardly used. So I started to
look deeperâ€¦
Once I figured out everything was fine, I was curious if everyone is
aware of the different phandle creation by dtc vs POWER. And I posted
the mail in the thread.
Once you confirmed that everything is "known / not an issue" I was ready
to take off [0].

Later more replies came in such as one mail [1] from Rob describing the
original reason with 814 phandles. _Here_ I was just surprised that 1024
were used over 64 entries for a benefit of 60ms. I understand that this
is low concern for you because that memory is released if modules are
not enabled. I usually see that module support is left enabled.

However, Rob suggested / asked about the fixed size array (this is how I
understood it):

|too.

so I attempted to ask if we should have the fixed size array maybe
with the hash_32() instead the mask. This would make my other patch
obsolete because the fixed size array should not have a RT issue. The
hash_32() part here would address the POWER issue where the cache is
currently not used efficiently.

If you want instead to keep things as-is then this is okay from my side.
If you want to keep this cache off on POWER then I could contribute a
patch doing so.
