+description: |+
+  ARM's Versatile Express platform were built as reference designs for exploring
+  multicore Cortex-A class systems. The Versatile Express family contains both
+  32 bit (Aarch32) and 64 bit (Aarch64) systems.
+
+  The board consist of a motherboard and one or more daughterboards (tiles). The
+  motherboard provides a set of peripherals. Processor and RAM "live" on the
+  tiles.
+
+  The motherboard and each core tile should be described by a separate Device
+  Tree source file, with the tile's description including the motherboard file
+  using an include directive. As the motherboard can be initialized in one of
+  two different configurations ("memory maps"), care must be taken to include
+  the correct one.
+
+  When a new generation of boards were introduced under the name "Juno", these
+  shared to many common characteristics with the Versatile Express that the
+  "arm,vexpress" compatible was retained in the root node, and these are
+  included in this binding schema as well.
+
+  The root node indicates the CPU SoC on the core tile, and this
+  is a daughterboard to the main motherboard. The name used in the compatible
+  string shall match the name given in the core tile's technical reference
+  manual, followed by "arm,vexpress" as an additional compatible value. If
+  further subvariants are released of the core tile, even more fine-granular
+  compatible strings with up to three compatible strings are used.
