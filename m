No worries, it's just worthwhile to study failures.  So IIUC, in this case:
mainline was 5.6
the broken patch was merged in 5.7 merge window
a fix was already in -next, but not slated for the new merge window.
(Maybe scheduled for 5.8?)

So it sounds like it can be dangerous to have 2 branches from 1 tree
flow into -next, as the branch meant for a later release can mask
failures in pull requests for the earlier release?

Do we know what and where the fix currently is?
Can we make sure it's sent to Linus for 5.7-rc1? (Or sooner?)
