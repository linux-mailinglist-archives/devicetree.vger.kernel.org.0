Hi everyone,

thanks for your feedback on v1.
Changes in v2:
* Acked-by: Rob Herring to PATCH 1
* Removed 'status' property for non-disabled devices in PATCH 2
* Removed superfluous blank lines in PATCH 2
* Removed doubled status = "disabled" in PATCH 2
* Moved 'chosen' node up in PATCH 2
* Removed unit-address for GPIO buttons in PATCH 2
* Removed internal (und unsupported) SPI device node in PATCH 2
* Removed QSPI flash partitions in PATCH 2
* Rename audio-codec node name in PATCH 2

Below is the summary from v1 which has not changed.

This patch series adds support for the TQ-Systems TQMa6ULx & TQMa6ULxL modules.
Admittedly the name can be confusing, so I'll explain in more detail.

TQMa6ULx [1] is the module series using i.MX6UL. The 'x' is a placeholder for
different variants which have a different ÂµC. TQMa6UL1 is using MCIMX6G1 which
has some peripheries disabled, more about it below. TQMa6UL2 (and TQMa6UL3)
has a full feature set and are treated identical on Linux side.

TQMa6ULxL [2] is the LGA variant of TQMa6ULx with a differnt module PCB, but
still common parts. There is no variant using MCIMX6G1.

TQMa6ULLx [1] is identical to TQMa6ULx, but using an i.MX6ULL instead.
There is no TQMa6UL1L.

TQMa6ULLxL [2] is identical to TQMa6ULxL, but using an i.MX6ULL instead.
There is no TQMa6ULL1L.

There are also 2 different mainboards namely MBAa6ULx & MBa6ULxL ('x' here is
not a placeholder, but part of the name). MBAa6ULx is for non-LGA variants
TQMa6ULx & TQMa6ULLx, while MBa6ULxL is used for TQMa6ULxL & TQMa6ULLxL.
It is also possible to mount a TQMa6ULxL to MBa6ULx using an LGA adapter
providing the sockets.

TQMa6UL1 uses MCIMX6G1 which has FEC2, CAN2, CSI and LCDIF disabled by fuses.
This wouldn't be a problem at all, iff fec would support EPROBE_DEFER for
Ethernet PHYs on a different MDIO bus. Both PHYs are connected to the same MDIO
bus. This is not a proble, but as FEC2 has the lower base address than FEC1
it is probed first. For this reason the PHYs have to be attached to FEC2 or
things wont work. But exactly this breaks on TQMa6UL1 which has no FEC2 at all.
There is a suggestion for fec driver at [3] but without solution (yet).
This is the single reason there is a 'tq,imx6ul-tqma6ul1' compatible.
In order for things to work, the PHYs have to be deleted from fec2 & mdio
subnode and added to fec1 again.

Regardings the file structure there is a .dtsi file for
* common common parts on all 4 module variants (LGA & non-LGA, imx6ul & imx6ull):
  imx6ul-tqma6ul-common.dtsi
* common to non-LGA variants only: imx6ul-tqma6ulx-common.dtsi
* common to LGA variants only: imx6ul-tqma6ulxl-common.dtsi

This is valid for both TQMa6ULx and TQMa6ULLx. To not introduce another file
name separation, 'imx6ul-' is the prefix for common parts for imx6ul as well
as imx6ull.

Best regards,
Alexander
