Mind you, I'd prefer for those people to argue their use case themselves 
as I'm still not fully convinced myself. But yeah, this has something to 
do with latency.

And v2 of the spec goes a step further by making the DAA procedure give 
you the PID/DCR/BCR of the winning device before you provide it the 
address to be assigned, so you could skip SETDASA/SETNEWDA altogether by 
giving it the final address up front. But in order for this to work the 
subsystem would have to provide a query method that would go like: 
here's some PID/DCR/BCR: please give me the best address to assign this 
device... oh and do so within a 150ms delay.

Right. At least now you've been warned this might be coming.
