Convert the DT binding documentation for the TI TFP410 DPI-to-DVI
encoder to json-schema.

Hi all,

I found some issues while converting this binding and I'd like to know
your opinions on how to tackle them.

1) dtbs_check fails for arch/arm/boot/dts/dove-sbc-a510.dts

  This board uses the TFP410 encoder but it doesn't define any ports for
  it. I can't find any suitable remote endpoints in its description
  either. Maybe this board description should be reworked? The current
  driver won't handle the device if it doesn't define any ports or
  endpoints anyway.

  It also uses the 'powerdown-gpio' property instead of
  'powerdown-gpios'. AFAICT this shouldn't be a problem from the driver
  point of view, but the general standard in DT bindings is to use the
  plural. This is trivial to fix.

2) The definition of ti,deskew in the original binding seems to be
tailored to the current driver and the way it's defined may not be very
DT-friendly.

  This parameter maps to a 3-bit field in a hardware register that takes
  a value from 0 to 7, so the [-4, 3] range described for this would map
  to [000, 111]: -4 -> 000, -3 -> 001, -2 -> 010, ... 3 -> 111.

  Then, the driver parses the parameter (unsigned) and casts it to a
  signed integer to get a number in the [-4, 3] range.

  A vendor-specific property must have a type definition in json-schema,
  so if I translate the original bindings semantics directly, I should
  define ti,deskew as an int32, but this makes dt_binding_check fail if
  the property has a negative value in the example because of the
  internal representation of cells as unsigned integers:

     ti,deskew:0:0: 4294967293 is greater than the maximum of 2147483647

  So I can think of two solutions to this:

  a) Keep the ti,deskew property as an uint32 and document the valid
  range ([-4, 3]) in the property description (this is what this patch
  does currently).

  b) Redefine this property to be closer to the datasheet description
  (ie. unsigned integers from 0 to 7) and adapt the driver accordingly.
  This would also let us define its range properly using minimum and
  maximum properties for it.

  I think (b) is the right thing to do but I want to know your
  opinion. Besides, I don't have this hardware at hand and if I updated
  the driver I wouldn't be able to test it.

Thanks.

Patch tested with:

make dt_binding_check ARCH=arm DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<.../ti,tfp410.yaml>
make dtbs_check ARCH=arm DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<.../ti,tfp410.yaml>

-TFP410 DPI to DVI encoder
-=========================
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible: "ti,tfp410"
-
-Optional properties:
-- powerdown-gpios: power-down gpio
-- reg: I2C address. If and only if present the device node should be placed
-  into the I2C controller node where the TFP410 I2C is connected to.
-- ti,deskew: data de-skew in 350ps increments, from -4 to +3, as configured
-  through th DK[3:1] pins. This property shall be present only if the TFP410
-  is not connected through I2C.
-
-Required nodes:
-
-This device has two video ports. Their connections are modeled using the OF
-graph bindings specified in [1]. Each port node shall have a single endpoint.
-
-- Port 0 is the DPI input port. Its endpoint subnode shall contain a
-  pclk-sample and bus-width property and a remote-endpoint property as specified
-  in [1].
-  - If pclk-sample is not defined, pclk-sample = 0 should be assumed for
-    backward compatibility.
-  - If bus-width is not defined then bus-width = 24 should be assumed for
-    backward compatibility.
-    bus-width = 24: 24 data lines are connected and single-edge mode
-    bus-width = 12: 12 data lines are connected and dual-edge mode
-
-- Port 1 is the DVI output port. Its endpoint subnode shall contain a
-  remote-endpoint property is specified in [1].
