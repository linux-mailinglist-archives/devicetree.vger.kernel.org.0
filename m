Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: display: analogix_dp.txt: convert to yaml
Date:   Fri, 24 Apr 2020 13:26:34 +0200

This converts the DT binding for the Analogix DP bridge used in
the Exynos 5 and Rockchip RK3288/RK3399 SoCs to yaml.

Changes from the original binding:
- phy and phy-names aren't defined as 'required' (rk3399-evb.dts doesn't
  define them)

This binding is meant to be used in conjunction with
Documentation/bindings/display/rockchip/analogix_dp-rockchip.txt
and
Documentation/bindings/display/exynos/exynos_dp.txt

I was careful to define the bindings to be flexible enough for both
cases, since the properties might be slightly different depending
on the SoC.

Tested with
make dt_binding_check ARCH=arm64 DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...analogix_dp.yaml>
make dtbs_check ARCH=arm64 DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...analogix_dp.yaml>

-Required properties for dp-controller:
-	-compatible:
-		platform specific such as:
-		 * "samsung,exynos5-dp"
-		 * "rockchip,rk3288-dp"
-		 * "rockchip,rk3399-edp"
-	-reg:
-		physical base address of the controller and length
-		of memory mapped region.
-	-interrupts:
-		interrupt combiner values.
-	-clocks:
-		from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
-	-clock-names:
-		from common clock binding: Shall be "dp".
-	-phys:
-		from general PHY binding: the phandle for the PHY device.
-	-phy-names:
-		from general PHY binding: Should be "dp".
-
-Optional properties for dp-controller:
-	-force-hpd:
-		Indicate driver need force hpd when hpd detect failed, this
-		is used for some eDP screen which don't have hpd signal.
-	-hpd-gpios:
-		Hotplug detect GPIO.
-		Indicates which GPIO should be used for hotplug detection
-	-port@[X]: SoC specific port nodes with endpoint definitions as defined
-		in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt,
-		please refer to the SoC specific binding document:
