Right, I initially had clock too there and didn't notice the above 2 doesn't
need the numbering, will drop it.

OK that sounds cleaner.

Agreed, I did that for SCMI regulators, will follow that here too.

Understood. I should have tested removing properties in the example like
I did for SCMI. I must have show less interest for SCPI as it is old and
almost deprecated üòÅ. I will fix it.
