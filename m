I agree and am still in confusion as what to put inside soc or not.

I think I prefer that for v5.5 as a fix as this is much bigger churn. We
can do that for v5.6 if required. Let me know if you disagree. I can simply
revert your original patch adding dma-ranges for now and we can add it
later with all the soc structure.
