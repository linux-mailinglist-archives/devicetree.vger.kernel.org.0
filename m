Not sure I follow. How would u-boot fill in properties it needs for
itself? The properties could be populated whenever the partitions are.
Just as stdout-path is populated when the uart node is.

No problem with that as long as the properties are documented.

/chosen already has a schema in dt-schema[1]. Add it there or add a
chosen-u-boot.yaml.
