You don't really need frequency scaling though, you just need to set
it to any of the OPP. And if that's still too complicated, the binding
mandates to associate a vendor compatible, so you can base the
information on that.

Right before the driver is probed. For all you now, that frequency can
be changed to anything else at the very next operation and you'd end
up in the exact same situation than the one you're trying to fix.
