OpenBSD is using "openbsd," as a prefix.  I've always thought it would
be good to have it listed in the list of vendor prefixes there.  In an
open source world it shouldn't matter whether an entity sells
something or not.  And in fact "inux," is already there.  And so is
"qemu,".

On OpenBSD we do indeed use the the chosen node to pass information
between the bootloader and the kernel.

Cheers,
