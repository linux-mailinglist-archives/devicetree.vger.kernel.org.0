One thing I should mention upfront; there is too much code "doing
things" in here for it to be an MFD.  MFDs don't care about; syncs,
slots, TDM, inverting lines, upstreams, downstreams, etc etc etc.
Anything remotely technical or functional, the code that "does things"
should be moved out to the relevant areas.  In the case of this
device, that's looking like one of the Audio related subsystems.
