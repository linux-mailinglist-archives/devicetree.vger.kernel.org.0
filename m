I am agree with you, we should not add SPI-NAND changes inside
raw NAND subsystem.

Initially I was started writing separate driver under SPI-NAND subsystem 
then I
realized that more than 85% of raw/qcom_nand.c code getting duplicated.

That's why I have added this SPI-NAND change in raw/qcom_nand.c since
more than 85% of code will be reused.

If I will add this change inside SPI-NAND subsystem then much of
raw/qcom_nand.c code will get duplicated. Would it be ok ?
