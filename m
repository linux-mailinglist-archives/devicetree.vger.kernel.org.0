Applications will send compression / decompression requests to NX with
COPY/PASTE instructions. When NX is processing these requests, can hit
fault on the request buffer (not in memory). It issues an interrupt and
pastes fault CRB in fault FIFO. Expects kernel to handle this fault and
return credits for both send and fault windows after processing.

This patch series adds IRQ and fault window setup, and NX fault handling:
- Read IRQ# from "interrupts" property and configure IRQ per VAS instance.
- Set port# for each window to generate an interrupt when noticed fault.
- Set fault window and FIFO on which NX paste fault CRB.
- Setup IRQ thread fault handler per VAS instance.
- When receiving an interrupt, Read CRBs from fault FIFO and update
  coprocessor_status_block (CSB) in the corresponding CRB with translation
  failure (CSB_CC_TRANSLATION). After issuing NX requests, process polls
  on CSB address. When it sees translation error, can touch the request
  buffer to bring the page in to memory and reissue NX request.
- If copy_to_user fails on user space CSB address, OS sends SEGV signal.

Tested these patches with NX-GZIP support and will be posting this series
soon.

Patch 2: Define nx_fault_stamp on which NX writes fault status for the fault
         CRB
Patch 3: Read interrupts and port properties per VAS instance
Patch 4: Setup fault window per each VAS instance. This window is used for
         NX to paste fault CRB in FIFO.
Patches 5 & 6: Setup threaded IRQ per VAS and register NX with fault window
	 ID and port number for each send window so that NX paste fault CRB
	 in this window.
Patch 7: Reference to pid and mm so that pid is not used until window closed.
	 Needed for multi thread application where child can open a window
	 and can be used by parent later.
Patches 8 and 9: Process CRBs from fault FIFO and notify tasks by
         updating CSB or through signals.
Patches 10 and 11: Return credits for send and fault windows after handling
        faults.
Patch 13:Fix closing send window after all credits are returned. This issue
         happens only for user space requests. No page faults on kernel
         request buffer.

Changelog:
V2:
  - Use threaded IRQ instead of own kernel thread handler
  - Use pswid insted of user space CSB address to find valid CRB
  - Removed unused macros and other changes as suggested by Christoph Hellwig
