For end users who want to measure straightforward things like SLC usage, 
the default of counting across all relevant nodes is usually what 
they're going to want anyway, and conveniently means they don't need to 
know the details. For targeted measurements, even if you know all the 
node IDs, how will you know which CPU/memory controller/peripheral/etc. 
they correspond to? Just like for CCN and CCI, to do pretty much 
anything *meaningful* you'll need independent information about the 
wider SoC configuration to know what's connected where, and that 
information should inherently give you the node/port IDs anyway.

That said, I did end up writing some more comprehensive debugfs output 
for my own development use, and also based on discussions around 
tangential development cases like CHI cache-stashing research. I've 
included that in v2, so if you think it deserves to be upstream please 
do say so.

Thanks,
Robin.
