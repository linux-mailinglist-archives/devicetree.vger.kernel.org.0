Subject: [RFT PATCH 0/5] Convert adi,adv7511.txt DT bindings to yaml

Hi,

This series convert the adi,adv7511.txt DT bindings to json-schema. As a
result of the conversion some dts files needed to be updated.

The changes to the dts files are of two types:

  - Reordering of the I2C slave addresses list of the ADV75xx node. The
    addresses in the 'reg' property and the matching names in
    'reg-names' for an I2C slave don't need to be in any particular
    order, but the DT schema defines these properties as a cell array
    and a string array respectively, which are ordered, so the
    definitions in the dts files must match the order in the binding.

  - Filling the minimum binding requirements. Most of the time this
    means creating a 'ports' node in the boards that don't define
    them. Note, however, that the purpose of this is simply to make the
    definition compliant with the binding. I didn't define any endpoints
    for the ports.

About the binding conversion:

  - The dependencies between properties are properly modelled but the
    result might look cluttered. If you find it hard to read or
    maintain, another option is to split the binding in two: one for the
    ADV7511/11w/13 and another one for the ADV7533/35.

Patches 1/5 to 4/5 contain the dts changes. Patch 5/5 contains the
binding conversion.

NOTE: the bindings have been tested with:

  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7511.yaml>
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7511.yaml>

for <arch> = arm and arm64. dts changes haven't been tested in hardware.

Kind regards,
Ricardo
