In general, I consider these as stuff that needs to be added to the board dts
files. You will see that this is what I have followed on all the TI
AM57xx/DRA7xx boards. For J721E, we have a weird organization as the memory
node, typically a board property, is defined in the som dtsi file, so the
reserved memory nodes are also added in the som dtsi file. The convention I
followed in general is to have the reserved-memory and memory nodes together.

If you think the mailbox nodes should be moved into the SoM dts file, I could do
it as a follow-on cleanup series, but would wait for the ABI 3.0 changes to be
merged first.

Suman
