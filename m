Yeah occasionally big series is totally fine for -misc. We're pulling in
pretty big amounts of refactoring all the time, so really doesn't make a
difference.

tbh I dunno either when too much is too much for -misc. I think tilcdc and
omapdrm should both easily fit (maybe after the big rewrite). If the shiny
new one here becomes too big we can always reconsider.

I think the really big drivers like amdgpu or intel don't belong in -misc,
that one is clear. In between I guess we'll see.

Whatever floats the boat, with a preference for not having tiny trees
(simply because those pull request tend to get lost in the noise).
