This is also my understanding after some googling. And there's even of_property_read_s32() in the 
kernel.

Well, this is in the nitpick category, and maybe not even relevant, but I don't think that's 
correct. They're just bits. Some pieces of SW happen to use u32 containers to store the bits. But 
what the bits mean is not related to the container.

Doesn't all this just point to a bug or missing feature in dt_binding_check? That's not a reason to 
change the ABI.
