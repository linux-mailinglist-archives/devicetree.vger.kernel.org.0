It would be just wonderful if we could have only a few
dt-bindings for the simple panels.
Like you I cannot see why enable-gpios should be required.

We could end up with something like three classes of bindings:

+required:
+  - compatible
+  - power-supply

+required:
+  - compatible
+  - port
+  - power-supply

+required:
+  - backlight
+  - compatible
+  - port
+  - power-supply

The port part is to my best understanding a way to
connect the panel to the display driver.
So it should be more how the connect in the binding
that decides if port is used or not.
And the panel should not require it.

I may use it with display drivers that do not support it
in their binding.

And then we have backlight - which can hardly be mandatory.
The panel could hard-wire it to provide backligt if it wanted
and the binding should continue to work.
I think you had the same argument.

So we are down to two required properties:
+required:
+  - compatible
+  - power-supply

Could we put all simple panels in one binding file
with only this - that would be great.
Hopefully scripted somehow...

Then adding new simple panels would be a matter of
adding a new compatible.
And if they are sorted this should not cause many merge issues either.

I hope I understood you correct.
