Hi Akash,

Great, I was concerned there would be conflicts without a rebase.

It's not a pure resend, since it has changes in "spi:
spi-qcom-qspi: Add interconnect support":

  Changes in Resend V7:
   - As per Matthias comment removed "unsigned int avg_bw_cpu" from
      struct qcom_qspi as we are using that variable only once.

Please increase the version number whenever you make changes or rebase.

Maintainers tend to be busy, before doing actual resends folks often
send a ping/inquiry on the original patch/series, and only resend it when
they didn't receive a response after some time.

Thanks

Matthias
