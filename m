IMO the important part is that we encode an exact version (or commit if 
they're going to stop doing versions) of the spec in the DT.  We've 
gotten burned enough times by just trying to point at the latest spec 
and trusting that compatibility will be handled in the specs, in 
practice that doesn't work.

Given how inconsistent the RISC-V version schemes have been, we really 
can't assign any semantic meaning to version numbers.  So I don't think 
it matters all that much if we encode this as

    riscv,$SPEC = ["v1.0", "v1.1"]

or

    riscv,$SPEC = true // with the binding saying v1.0 or $SHA...
    riscv,$SPEC-1.1 = true // with the binding saying v1.1 or $SHA...

Since we can't ascribe any meaning to those version numbers there's 
nothing to parse in them, so it's just going to plumb into some lookup 
table in the kernel either way.  The important part is just that we 
document exactly what spec version we're encoding, as that way we can 
avoid getting burned by these changes again in the future.

IMO that's the most important deciding factor on how these should be 
encoded.  We're not tracking the ISA string any more, so it doesn't 
matter how closely those line up.  We do have a chance to actually 
validate the interface, though, which was a big problem with the ISA 
strings.

From talking it sounds like the form you're proposing is easier to 
encode in dt-schema than what I'd proposed.  I didn't look at dt-schema 
at all before thinking up the interface, so you're probably right ;).

Assuming that's the case it seems like the way to go as for as I'm 
concerned.

IMO there's not any fundamental difference: it's not like the standard 
extensions have any meaningful naming/versioning scheme, so it's still 
all just lookup tables.

We do get the same benefits from schema validation that we'd get for 
standard extensions, though.  That's probably a way bigger win for 
vendor extensions, as it'll close a big loophole in our DT validation 
right now where users can cram arbitrary stuff into "riscv,isa" and then 
we have to just deal with it.
