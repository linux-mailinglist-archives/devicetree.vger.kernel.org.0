Subject: [PATCH v3 0/4] Convert adi,adv7511.txt DT bindings to yaml

Hi,

This series convert the adi,adv7511.txt DT bindings to json-schema. As a
result of the conversion some dts files needed to be updated.

The changes to the dts files are of three types:

  - Reordering of the I2C slave addresses list of the ADV75xx node. The
    addresses in the 'reg' property and the matching names in
    'reg-names' for an I2C slave don't need to be in any particular
    order, but the DT schema defines these properties as a cell array
    and a string array respectively, which are ordered, so the
    definitions in the dts files must match the order in the binding.

  - Filling the minimum binding requirements. Most of the time this
    means creating a 'ports' node in the boards that don't define
    them. Note, however, that the purpose of this is simply to make the
    definition compliant with the binding. I didn't define any endpoints
    for the ports.

  - Removing unneeded properties.

About the binding conversion:

  - The original binding covered five different devices: ADV7511,
    ADV7511W, ADV7513, ADV7533 and ADV7535. They all share a common set
    of properties but ADV7533 and ADV7535 have enough differences from
    the rest to warrant their own binding file. In v1 I modelled all the
    properties constraints for all five devices in a single file but it
    turned out a bit too complex. Splitting the binding into one for
    ADV7511/11W/13 and another for ADV7533/35 makes them much easier to
    read and maintain.

Patches 1/4 to 3/4 contain the dts changes. Patch 4/4 contains the
binding conversion.

NOTE: the bindings have been tested with:

  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7511.yaml>
  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7533.yaml>
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7511.yaml>
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...adi,adv7533.yaml>

for <arch> = arm and arm64. dts changes haven't been tested in hardware.

Some existing DTs are expected to fail after this conversion.

Changes in v3:

  - Removed from the patch series (already in mainline):
    - arm64: dts: renesas: make hdmi encoder nodes compliant with DT bindings
    - ARM: dts: renesas: make hdmi encoder nodes compliant with DT bindings
    - ARM: dts: iwg20d-q7-dbcm-ca: remove unneeded properties in hdmi@39

  - Additional DTs fixes:
    - boot/dts/stm32mp15xx-dhcor-avenger96.dtsi.

  - [Laurent] adi,adv7511.yaml and adi,adv7533.yaml.
    - Documentation fixes and typos.
    - Removed unnecessary allOf's.
    - adi,embedded-sync data type changed to boolean.
    - Power supplies defined as required.
    - Examples updated.
