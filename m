Hello devicetree

I know it's an unconventional way of reaching out to you but it's
for a good cause.

I=E2=80=99m Donald, a Research Assistant of the Research and Development
Department working at one of the leading Bio Pharmaceutical
Companies here in England. I'm looking for a reliable business
person in your region to represent my company in sourcing some of
our basic raw material used in the manufacturing of high quality
Anti-Viral Vaccines, Cancer treatment and other lifesaving
Pharmaceutical Products.

This may not be your area of specialization but it will be
another income generating business out of your specialty. This is
because Our company is yet to locate any seller to buy from,
however, I have been able to discover a local dealer who can
supply us with this product. He is selling at a cheap rate ,
which is far cheaper than our previous purchases.

I will give you more specific profit details when I receive
feedback from you if you are interested.


Best regards

Donald Kolman
