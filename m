(did you mean to CC me or have I missed another thread elsewhere?)

FWIW I still think it would be good to fix the clock driver(s) and/or 
DTs to correctly deal with the availability and configuration of xin_32k 
where appropriate. However, much like the HCLK_VO mess I guess that's a 
larger cleanup tangent in its own right, so using "assigned-clocks" for 
this one case in the meantime doesn't seem unreasonable. I was 
optimistic for the cleanest, most generic solution, but if reality gets 
in the way then oh well.

Judging by the datasheet, RK3568 might actually have a similar situation 
with its clk32k_in pin, so you may want "assigned-clock-parents" as well 
to ensure the whole clk_rtc32k branch is really set up the way you 
currently expect - baking any more assumptions into DTBs now only seems 
to add potential for breakage if kernel behaviour changes in future.

Robin.
