It seems like somehow that particular GPIO doesn't get configured 
properly and is still in its default out-of-reset state as an input. 
Poking the GPIO from sysfs works as expected, and in fact just unbinding 
and rebinding the leds-gpio driver also manages to kick things into 
shape. Clearly there's some subtle driver-level issue, but at least it's 
not a DT problem :)

On second look it's already present in half the existing RK3328 DTs 
(including the one I wrote, ahem...), so probably does deserve promoting 
into the DTSI.

Yeah, mine came with the version 2 heatsink/fan fitted, although upon 
investigation it turns out the PWM is next to useless (something's off 
with rise times in the external MOSFET switching setup) and the fan 
connector may as well just be treated as GPIO-controlled anyway.

FWIW SDR104 seems to be working fine for me, with the PMIC interrupt 
corrected so as not to break the regulator.

Actually I think I was mistaken there - having double-checked the 
binding definition and datasheet it looks like RK3328 doesn't expose the 
WP function on any pin at all, so by the letter of the binding this 
*should* be specified for correctness (since we don't necessarily know 
for sure that the controller's internal WP line isn't left floating). 
Sorry for the confusion.

Cheers,
Robin.
