Indeed, for an example see arm_v7s_install_table() and how 
__arm_v7s_map() calls it. The LPAE version in io-pgtable-arm.c does the 
same too, but with some extra software-bit handshaking to track the 
cache maintenance state as an optimisation, which you can probably do 
without trying to make sense of ;)
