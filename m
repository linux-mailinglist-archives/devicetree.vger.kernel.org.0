This comes from the discussion in the previous version of this series.

In the DTs that don't define any ports (it's dove-sbc-a510.dts only, actually)
it's not clear how to define the ports (I'm not familiar with this board).
Initially I defined a set of empty ports just to comply with the binding
requirements, but Rob suggested that we might as well declare them as optional,
since having an empty port definition with no remote endpoints is no better than
having no ports at all.

I understand both opinions but I just don't know which is the best option at
this point.

Cheers,
Ricardo
