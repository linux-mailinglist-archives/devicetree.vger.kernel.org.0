Yes, but...

I thought devices got clocks from the LPCG?

I'm not suggesting that. It's really just re-arranging all the same
data from a bunch of child nodes to a single node. Granted, it may be
easier to add/delete nodes than add/delete elements from an array of
property values, but really that's just a tooling problem

That was my original thought, but we could just say the clock-indices
element size is equal to the #clock-cells size and use 2 cells.
