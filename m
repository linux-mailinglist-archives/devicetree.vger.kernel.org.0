I applied this, just to throw this throgh my build setup.

checkpatch reported:
total: 0 errors, 45 warnings, 46 checks, 4920 lines checked

- space after cast
- CamelCase
- Macro argument
- length warnings
- alignment

I would ignore the line length warnings for the coefficients, but fix the
rest.
