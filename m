The binding documentation for these drivers are here [0]. The display
bindings are documented as:
- compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-disp-<function>", one of

The <chip> placeholder is never expanded for all the supported chips.
The 5 existings matches from your grep command comes from the example.
I guess these will be fixed whenever someone converts [0] to yaml.
