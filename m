Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] Fix checker warnings related to cros-ec binding

This series fixes a bunch of warnings related to the google,cros-ec
binding, originally reported by Rob Herring.
The patches involve adding missing subnode definitions in the
google,cros-ec binding and the conversion of two existing bindings to
json-schema.

All the related warnings should be fixed after applying the patches,
except for a couple of warnings in the device trees of Qualcomm's
Trogdor and Cheza chromebooks. They define a pdupdate subnode inside
cros-ec that has no binding, the development of drivers and support for
these chromebooks is ongoing and not completely upstreamed yet.

Bindings tested with:

  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=...
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=...

for <arch> = arm and arm64.

Changes from v2:

  - [Rob] bindings/input/google,cros-ec-keyb.yaml restored to the v1
    version (ie. using unevaluatedProperties: false and referencing
    input/matrix-keymap.yaml)

Regarding the discussion [1] about the addition of a new "codecs"
intermediate node in google,cros-ec.yaml to hold the ec-codec, I decided
to leave it in since I think that should be the proper way to define
it. Currently there's no hardware nor DTs using that device, so when
it's eventually used the sound/soc/codecs/cros_ec_codec.c driver should
be updated to handle the DT structure properly.
