Hello good day, I am the above named person. Ms. Siena Ross, My dear,
writing this message to you now is not by my power, rather a divine
direction from God Almighty who has chosen you for a great
responsibility of his only child, knowing too well that you will not
betray his trust in you because he knows why he has directed me to you
at this point in time so do not be afraid,

it is the situation of things surrounding me that has made me to cry
out as i was touched by God Almighty to open up to you because I never
knew things would turn this way after a painful death of my beloved
husband.

I and my late husband have been working in the TGC GOLD LIMITED for 39
years with only one child of 10 years old son, before I became sick
and very unwell up to the dates and we deposited the sum of
(US$18.9Million) in a Bank.

Recently my doctor told me that I would not last for the periods of
next few weeks due to cancer problem and my surgery operations are
soonest and desire this money to be transferred to you sooner before
my surgery,

having known my condition I decided to hand you over this money to
secure and invest partly for the benefit and education of my son who
will be staying under your kind custody until he is matured enough to
take care of himself. Please your urgent response will be appreciated
through my private e-mail address :{ sienaross4@gmail.com} for
securities reasons as I don't know what tomorrow will result.
