I'm not sure what the situation is for Bootlin, but they don't seem to
be very responsive right now (covid related?)

What I know from what I've been party to on netdev is that Bootlin
sent a patch for the MVPP2 driver, and the very next day someone
reported that the patch caused a bug.  Unfortunately, the patch got
picked up anyway, but there was no response from Bootlin.  After a
month or so, -final was released containing this patch, so now it
had become a regression - and still no response from Bootlin.

Eventually the bug got fixed - not because Bootlin fixed it, but
because I ended up spending the time researching how that part of
the network driver worked, diagnosing what was going on, and
eventually fixing it in the most obvious way - but it's not clear
that the fix was the right approach.  Bootlin never commented.  See
3138a07ce219 ("net: mvpp2: fix RX hashing for non-10G ports").

So, I think we have to assume that Bootlin are struggling right now,
and as it's been over a week, it's unlikely that they are going to
respond soon.  What do you think we should do?

I also note that Rob has not responded to the DT binding change
either, despite me gently prodding, and Rob processing a whole raft
of DT binding stuff yesterday.

I can split the DTS change from the rest of the patch, but I don't
think that really helps without at least the binding change being
agreed.
