From, Mrs. Mary Armstrong

My dear beloved,

Greetings to you and your family. My name is Mrs. Mary Laren Armstrong
from USA, l am 59 years old childless widow suffering from Esophageal
Cancer, my husband died after testing positive for the corona virus
and recently my doctor told me that i have few months to live due to
the critical condition of my cancer illness. Having known my condition
i decided to donate my late husband funds worth US$7.5Million to help
the poor, widows and orphanages which in return will bring blessing
for my soul when i die.

I took this decision because my relatives and friends have failed me
and plundered so much of my money since my illness. If you are
interested to receive this money to help the poor and widows kindly
reply me back for more details.

Attached is my passport.

Best regards,
Mrs. Mary Armstrong
