I think you want something like this:

if:
  properties:
    compatible:
      contains:
        enum:
          - adi,adv7533
          - adi,adv7535
then:
  not:
    properties:
      adi,input-style: false
      adi,input-justification: false

Which means the schema fails if either property is present.

It may also just be easier to split this schema into 2. It's a
judgement call on how much is shared vs. how much if/then/else logic
there is.
