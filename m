And that's exactly the point where trying to push things into lower
layers starts to crumble. It only really makes sense if you manage to
establish a nice abstraction of what is happening in those lower
layers. If you need to punch through those abstractions due to system
design limitations, the benefit of those abstractions is wiped away.
The only thing you gain is more complexity due to more components being
involved in a specific task.

If you want to be able to partition the system (and as far as I
understand it that's the main motivation for pushing GPC functionality
into TF-A) you need to design the system (starting on the HW level) to
make this possible. Trying to force such a model on a system that
hasn't really been designed for this is IMHO doomed to fail.

Maybe that is what needs to be done to allow at least a partial
implementation of SCMI on the existing i.MX8M designs. However it
doesn't really provide much of the benefits of SCMI.

So I'm all for having a pure Linux based implementation of the
functionality, instead of waiting for the SCMI based implementation
that may provide only questionable benefit.
