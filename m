-Required nodes:
-The description for the board must include:
-   - a "psci" node describing the boot method used for the secondary CPUs.
-     A detailed description of the bindings used for "psci" nodes is present
-     in the psci.yaml file.
-   - a "cpus" node describing the available cores and their associated
-     "enable-method"s. For more details see cpus.yaml file.

-ARM Versatile Express boards family
------------------------------------
-
-ARM's Versatile Express platform consists of a motherboard and one
-or more daughterboards (tiles). The motherboard provides a set of
-peripherals. Processor and RAM "live" on the tiles.
-
-The motherboard and each core tile should be described by a separate
-Device Tree source file, with the tile's description including
-the motherboard file using a /include/ directive. As the motherboard
-can be initialized in one of two different configurations ("memory
-maps"), care must be taken to include the correct one.
-
-
-Root node
----------
-
-Required properties in the root node:
-- compatible value:
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,<model>", "arm,vexpress";
-  where <model> is the full tile model name (as used in the tile's
-    Technical Reference Manual), eg.:
-    - for Coretile Express A5x2 (V2P-CA5s):
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,v2p-ca5s", "arm,vexpress";
-    - for Coretile Express A9x4 (V2P-CA9):
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,v2p-ca9", "arm,vexpress";
-  If a tile comes in several variants or can be used in more then one
-  configuration, the compatible value should be:
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,<model>,<variant>", \
-				"arm,vexpress,<model>", "arm,vexpress";
-  eg:
-    - Coretile Express A15x2 (V2P-CA15) with Tech Chip 1:
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,v2p-ca15,tc1", \
-				"arm,vexpress,v2p-ca15", "arm,vexpress";
-    - LogicTile Express 13MG (V2F-2XV6) running Cortex-A7 (3 cores) SMM:
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,v2f-2xv6,ca7x3", \
-				"arm,vexpress,v2f-2xv6", "arm,vexpress";
-
-Optional properties in the root node:
-- tile model name (use name from the tile's Technical Reference
-  Manual, eg. "V2P-CA5s")
-	model = "<model>";
-- tile's HBI number (unique ARM's board model ID, visible on the
-  PCB's silkscreen) in hexadecimal transcription:
-	arm,hbi = <0xhbi>
-  eg:
-  - for Coretile Express A5x2 (V2P-CA5s) HBI-0191:
-	arm,hbi = <0x191>;
-  - Coretile Express A9x4 (V2P-CA9) HBI-0225:
-	arm,hbi = <0x225>;
-
-
-CPU nodes
----------
-
-Top-level standard "cpus" node is required. It must contain a node
-with device_type = "cpu" property for every available core, eg.:
-
-	cpus {
-		#address-cells = <1>;
-		#size-cells = <0>;
-
-		cpu@0 {
-			device_type = "cpu";
-			compatible = "arm,cortex-a5";
-			reg = <0>;
-		};
-	};
-
-
-Configuration infrastructure
-----------------------------
-
-The platform has an elaborated configuration system, consisting of
-microcontrollers residing on the mother- and daughterboards known
-as Motherboard/Daughterboard Configuration Controller (MCC and DCC).
-The controllers are responsible for the platform initialization
-(reset generation, flash programming, FPGA bitfiles loading etc.)
-but also control clock generators, voltage regulators, gather
-environmental data like temperature, power consumption etc. Even
-the video output switch (FPGA) is controlled that way.
-
-The controllers are not mapped into normal memory address space
-and must be accessed through bridges - other devices capable
-of generating transactions on the configuration bus.
-
-The nodes describing configuration controllers must define
-the following properties:
-- compatible value:
-	compatible = "arm,vexpress,config-bus";
-- bridge phandle:
-	arm,vexpress,config-bridge = <phandle>;
-and children describing available functions.
-
-
-Platform topology
------------------
-
-As Versatile Express can be configured in number of physically
-different setups, the device tree should describe platform topology.
-Root node and main motherboard node must define the following
-property, describing physical location of the children nodes:
-- site number:
-	arm,vexpress,site = <number>;
-  where 0 means motherboard, 1 or 2 are daugtherboard sites,
-  0xf means "master" site (site containing main CPU tile)
-- when daughterboards are stacked on one site, their position
-  in the stack be be described with:
-	arm,vexpress,position = <number>;
-- when describing tiles consisting more than one DCC, its number
-  can be described with:
-	arm,vexpress,dcc = <number>;
-
-Any of the numbers above defaults to zero if not defined in
-the node or any of its parent.
-
-
-Motherboard
------------
-
-The motherboard description file provides a single "motherboard" node
-using 2 address cells corresponding to the Static Memory Bus used
-between the motherboard and the tile. The first cell defines the Chip
-Select (CS) line number, the second cell address offset within the CS.
-All interrupt lines between the motherboard and the tile are active
-high and are described using single cell.
-
-Optional properties of the "motherboard" node:
-- motherboard's memory map variant:
-	arm,v2m-memory-map = "<name>";
-  where name is one of:
-  - "rs1" - for RS1 map (i.a. peripherals on CS3); this map is also
-            referred to as "ARM Cortex-A Series memory map":
-	arm,v2m-memory-map = "rs1";
-  When this property is missing, the motherboard is using the original
-  memory map (also known as the "Legacy memory map", primarily used
-  with the original CoreTile Express A9x4) with peripherals on CS7.
-
-Motherboard .dtsi files provide a set of labelled peripherals that
-can be used to obtain required phandle in the tile's "aliases" node:
-- UARTs, note that the numbers correspond to the physical connectors
-  on the motherboard's back panel:
-	v2m_serial0, v2m_serial1, v2m_serial2 and v2m_serial3
-- I2C controllers:
-	v2m_i2c_dvi and v2m_i2c_pcie
-- SP804 timers:
-	v2m_timer01 and v2m_timer23
-
-The tile description should define a "smb" node, describing the
-Static Memory Bus between the tile and motherboard. It must define
-the following properties:
-- "simple-bus" compatible value (to ensure creation of the children)
-	compatible = "simple-bus";
-- mapping of the SMB CS/offset addresses into main address space:
-	#address-cells = <2>;
-	#size-cells = <1>;
-	ranges = <...>;
-- interrupts mapping:
-	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
-	interrupt-map-mask = <0 0 63>;
-	interrupt-map = <...>;
