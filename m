My best guess is: It's complicated. While there was a recent big
UPSET EVENT regarding the My Book Live (MBL) that affected "hundreds"
and "thousands": "An unpleasant surprise for My Book Live owners"
(<https://lwn.net/Articles/861235/>). Sadly this wasn't getting any
traction.

I can tell that the mentioned Cisco Meraki MR32 (Broadcom ARM SoC)
got merged. So this is off the plate ðŸ˜Œ.

But APM821xx sadly went nowhere ðŸ˜•. One reason being that I haven't
yet posted a V4, V5 and so on...

In theory, for v4 I would have liked to know how to handle the
kConfig aspect of the series: Would it be "OK" to have a
single CONFIG_APM82181/CONFIG_APM821XX symbol or should there
be a CONFIG_MBL the CONFIG_MR24 (CONFIG_WNDR4700 and CONFIG_MX60W
in the future)?

As for the MBL: Well, If you (or any one else) is interested in
having a more up-to-date Debian. Then I have something:

A while back, I made a "build.sh". This will build a
"out-of-the-box" Debian unstable/SID powerpc system image.
This includes sensible NAS defaults + programs as well as
a Cockpit Web-GUI. But also makes it easily possible to do
the DTBs development on the latest vanilla (5.14-rc2 as of
the time of writing this) kernel for the
MyBook Live Single and Duo:

<https://github.com/chunkeey/mbl-debian>

I can't really make one for the MR24 though. Its 32MiB NAND
makes it difficult to install anything else than OpenWrt
(and get some use out of the device).

So, how to proceed?

Cheers,
Christian

PS.: As for PPC44x health regarding APM82181: It works!

This is with a My Book Live (MBL) and the 5.14.0-rc2(+) kernel.
