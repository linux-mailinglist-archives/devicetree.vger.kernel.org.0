Ah, yes -- me too. This was a combination of two things:

1) The patch was originally sent to arm@kernel.org, not soc@kernel.org
2) I bounced it to there to apply it using PatchWork

... but, it seems that the bot won't reply to patches that have been
bounced, only those who were originally sent there.

In this case, I should have made a manual reply -- I've gotten too
used to the bot and relied on it doing it.

Not sure why, but I seem to have missed it. Maybe because it was 3
patches on v5, and I didn't notice that one was now a cover letter.
Anyway, all good.

I'll also apply 1/2 shortly.
