Yes, if you have a string with defined values, then a type isn't needed. 
That only applies to strings as numeric values need a size.

Yes, that's a recent change. Both forms still work.

In theory the above should work. However, this is probably a case where 
we don't fix-up the properties. If you look at the DT yaml encoding, 
everything is an array (as dtc doesn't know). For schemas, the tooling 
expands scalars to arrays.
