I don't see any sign that Rob will ever review the DTS part, so I'm
at the point of just not caring about this anymore. I will carry it
in my tree, but I'm going to do nothing further.

That means that switching speed on mvneta on the Armada 38x is can
cause the network to die, but hey, if people can't be bothered to
review, and wish to impose rules such as "you can't change anything
with DT without my express say so" which have the effect of blocking
fixes, that's really not my problem.

So, shrug, I'm giving up with these patches.  Sorry.
