FWSPI pins are dedicated pins just for boot firmware SPI interface so
these pins don't need any pinmux setting. We just need to add pinmux
setting of AE12 and AF12 for a case when FWSPI needs QSPI support with
having these additional data pins. Do we need to define two groups
including a dummy group for the dedicated pins? Can you please share
more details of your idea? I don't see any example of dedicated pins in
the driver.
