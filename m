Hi Rob,

What's your opinion on this?

Some context: It's about bindings that define signed integer properties
with range checks that go below and above zero. The schema checker fails
because, apparently, it interprets every cell value as an uint32, which
makes the range check fail for negative numbers.

I haven't found any examples of yaml bindings defining signed integer
properties such as this, what's the norm in this case? Do you agree with
any of the proposed solutions? Do you have a better suggestion?
