Okay, that's a mess of names. I guess perhaps properties in /chosen
pointing to data would work. Then you just have to update that
property if you're switching partitions (using SPI vs. MMC or  for A/B
style partition switching). We should point to partitions rather than
raw offsets though.

One thing I'm not certain of is 'stdout-path' used a path string
rather than phandle. I'm not sure why. It may predate phandles or that
they weren't necessarily stable. Or just path string is more human
readable. So phandle vs. path/alias is something to figure out.
