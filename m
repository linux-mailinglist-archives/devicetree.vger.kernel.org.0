Note that I disagree strongly with removing the reference to the 
documentation that canonically defines the node ID format, especially 
when the proposal is to replace it with a harder-to-read definition that 
is also wrong ;)

If there's actually interest in using the coordinate format rather than 
just whole ID values, then we should generate format attributes that 
overlay the appropriate sections of the nodeid field. I haven't tried to 
implement that so far since it's not entirely trivial and I wasn't sure 
if anyone would care.

Ha, so much for taking my holiday after -rc6 and expecting to come back 
to chasing this up at -rc1... cheers Will, that was a very nice surprise 
to return to!

Robin.
