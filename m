Apologies for that. Indeed I should have added the board DT to the USB
series instead, as there is no dependency to anything in here.

If you don't mind, I will send a v3 with the last three patches
dropped, and the ACKs and R-b's added (and that one line in the commit
message fixed).

Cheers,
Andre
