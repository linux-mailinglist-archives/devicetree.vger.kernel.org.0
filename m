Yes, though it's also initially panels were just the child of the
controller before 'port' came along. We still allow both ways though
'port' is preferred.

Yes. The issue would be enforcing the big disclaimer of "Do not add
your panel here unless it has a single power rail." (And anything else
we think of). Between a single line add vs. a whole new doc, you know
what people will pick. I guess panels could still be moved out of the
common doc later on. We'd also have to be fighting off the "let me add
just one new property for my panel".

You did. I'd like to hear Thierry's thoughts on this before going down
this path.
