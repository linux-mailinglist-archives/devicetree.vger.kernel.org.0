Interestingly the current example has ti,deskew = <4>...

I don't quite understand this. We cannot have negative numbers in dts files? Or we can, but 
dt_binding_check doesn't handle them correctly? Or that int32 is not supported in yaml bindings?

I don't think anyone has used deskew property, so I guess changing it is not out of the question.

Laurent, did you have a board that needs deskew when you added it to tfp410?
