Well, maybe I'm wrong. If you have more than just transparent
remapping (i.e. mask/unmask/clear), then perhaps both are appropriate
because you want get the irq domain for the first irq parent.

You shouldn't really be parsing interrupt-map yourself. The code there
doesn't account for #address-cells which can be a factor for
interrupt-map. dtc is gaining some checks for 'interrupt-map', so
let's hope you have it right.
