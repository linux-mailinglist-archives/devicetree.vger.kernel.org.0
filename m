A broken example...

Eventually, I want to start reporting if compatible strings aren't 
documented (i.e. matched to a schema). This will break then...

This will fail because a size cell is expected.

I'd just drop both properties here. A 'dsi-controller' node name is 
enough to select this schema.

Just pick a real one. (Or drop the example because the binding for the 
real panel will have the same example).
