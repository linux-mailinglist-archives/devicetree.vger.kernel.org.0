Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] dt-bindings: display: ti,tfp410.txt: convert to yaml

This series converts the DT binding for the TI TFP410 DPI-to-DVI encoder
to json-schema.

It also fixes a minor bug in the ti-tfp410 driver that causes a
wrong calculation of the setup and hold times when the de-skew feature
is enabled. The retrieval of the de-skew value from the DT has also been
updated to reflect the binding changes.

Changes in v4:

  - ti,tfp410.yaml:
    - "ports" node set back as required (Laurent Pinchart). This means
      that dove-sbc-a510.dts will not comply with the binding and will
      have to be fixed at some point.

The bindings have been tested with:

  make dt_binding_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...ti,tfp410.yaml>
  make dtbs_check ARCH=<arch> DT_SCHEMA_FILES=<...ti,tfp410.yaml>

for <arch> = arm and arm64.
This uncovered a number of dts files that use the TFP410 but not through
I2C and don't define the ti,deskew property. These should also be fixed.
