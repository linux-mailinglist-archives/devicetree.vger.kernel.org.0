Dear friend,

I am Mr .Malik Sanfo, the head of file department of BANQUE
COMMERCIALE DU BURKINA here in Burkina Faso (BCB). In my department I
discover an abandoned sum of US$12.3mllion US Dollars in an account
that belongs to one of our foreign deceased customer.


It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this
business proposal to you and release the fund to you as the next of
kin or relation to the deceased for the safety and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it. I agree that 50% of this
fund will be for you, and 50%would be for me. Then after the money is
been transferred into your account, I will visit your country for an
investment under your kind control.

If you are really sure of your trustworthy, accountability and
confidentiality on this transaction, contact me and agree that you will
not change your mind to cheat or disappoint me when the fund have
being transferred into your account. Besides you should not entertain
any fear because I am sure of the success as an insider in the bank.
Please reply with the assurance, include your private telephone and
fax numbers necessary for facilitate an easy communication in this
transaction. As soon as you reply i will let you know the next step to
follow in order to finalize this transaction immediately. I expect
your urgent communication +226 6661 7838

I am waiting for your urgent respond to enable us proceed further for
the transfer.


Yours faithfully,
Mr .Malik Sanfo
