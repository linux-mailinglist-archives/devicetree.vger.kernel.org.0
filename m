If before the initial probe of the connector there is a /dev/dri/card0 
which plymouth can access, then plymouth may at this point decide
to disable any seemingly unused crtcs, which will make the screen go black...

I'm not sure if plymouth will actually do this, but AFAICT this would
not be invalid behavior for a userspace kms consumer to do and I
believe it is likely that mutter will disable unused crtcs.

IMHO it is just a bad idea to register /dev/dri/card0 with userspace
before the initial connector probe is done. Nothing good can come
of that.

If all the exposed connectors initially are going to show up as
disconnected anyways what is the value in registering /dev/dri/card0
with userspace early ?

See above.

Right, I missed the detail hat the connector is initially marked as
disconnected. That solves the issue of invalid panel-orient / mode /
dpi info, bit it opens up other problems.

The DMI based quirking does, yes. But e.g. the quirk code directly
reading this from the Intel VBT does not rely on the mode.

But if you are planning on using a DMI based quirk for the steamdeck
then yes that needs the mode.

Thee mode check is there for 2 reasons:

1. To avoid also applying the quirk to external displays, but
I think that that is also solved in most drivers by only checking for
a quirk at all on the eDP connector

2. Some laptop models ship with different panels in different badges
some of these are portrait (so need a panel-orient) setting and others
are landscape.

We could extend the DMI quirk mechanism to allow quirks which don't
do the mode check, for use on devices where we can guarantee neither
1 nor 2 happens, then amdgpu could call the quirk code early simply
passing 0x0 as resolution.

Ack.
