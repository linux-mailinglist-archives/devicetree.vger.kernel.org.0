Subject: [PATCH v3 14/21] drm/bridge: Add the necessary bits to support bus format negotiation

drm_bridge_state is extended to describe the input and output bus
configuration. This bus configuration is exposed through the
drm_bus_cfg struct which contains 2 properties: the bus format and
the bus flags.

Bus format negotiation is automated by the core, drivers just have
to implement the ->atomic_get_{output,input}_bus_fmts() hooks if they
want to take part to this negotiation. Negotiation happens in reserve
order, starting from the last element of the chain (the one directly
connected to the display) up to the first element of the chain (the one
connected to the encoder).
During this negotiation all supported formats are tested until we find
one that works, meaning that the formats array should be in decreasing
preference order (assuming the driver has a preference order).

Note that the bus format negotiation works even if some elements in the
chain don't implement the ->atomic_get_{output,input}_bus_fmts() hooks.
In that case, the core advertises only MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED and let
the previous bridge element decide what to do (most of the time, bridge
drivers will pick a default bus format of extract this piece of
information from somewhere else, like a FW property).

Bus flags negotiation is left to drivers which can simply propagate the
flags from the input of the next bridge element if there's no conversion
done inside the bridge, or tweak them if the bridge does some kind of
signal inversion.

---
Changes in v3:
* Fix the commit message (Reported by Laurent)
* Document the fact that bus formats should not be directly modified by
  drivers (Suggested by Laurent)
* Document the fact that format order matters (Suggested by Laurent)
* Propagate bus flags by default
* Document the fact that drivers can tweak bus flags if needed
* Let ->atomic_get_{output,input}_bus_fmts() allocate the bus format
  array (Suggested by Laurent)
* Add a drm_atomic_helper_bridge_propagate_bus_fmt()
* Mandate that bridge drivers return accurate input_fmts even if they
  are known to be the first element in the bridge chain

Changes in v2:
* Rework things to support more complex use cases

+ * This function is called by &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_check() just before

+ * It's providing bus format negotiation between bridge elements. The
+ * negotiation happens in reverse order, starting from the last element in
+ * the chain up to @bridge.
+ *
+ * Negotiation starts by retrieving supported output bus formats on the last
+ * bridge element and testing them one by one. The test is recursive, meaning
+ * that for each tested output format, the whole chain will be walked backward,
+ * and each element will have to choose an input bus format that can be
+ * transcoded to the requested output format. When a bridge element does not
+ * support transcoding into a specific output format -ENOTSUPP is returned and
+ * the next bridge element will have to try a different format. If none of the
+ * combinations worked, -ENOTSUPP is returned and the atomic modeset will fail.
+ *
+ * This implementation is relying on
+ * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() and
+ * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() to gather supported
+ * input/output formats.
+ * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_output_bus_fmts() is not implemented by
+ * the last element of the chain, &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts()
+ * tries a single format: &drm_connector.display_info.bus_formats[0] if
+ * available, MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED otherwise.
+ * When &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts() is not implemented,
+ * &drm_atomic_bridge_chain_select_bus_fmts() skips the negotiation on the
+ * bridge element that lacks this hook and asks the previous element in the
+ * chain to try MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED. It's up to bridge drivers to decide what
+ * to do in that case (fail if they want to enforce bus format negotiation, or
+ * provide a reasonable default if they need to support pipelines where not
