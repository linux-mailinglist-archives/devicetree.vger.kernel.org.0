Yes, that's probably right. We'd want things grouped if this was
something applied as an overlay.

It's made you think about the proper location, so it's accomplished
its goal. Maybe this is one that's not without false positives. It
would be good to distinguish between what's for sure a warning and
what's maybe a warning as just blindly fixing the warning is not the
answer.
