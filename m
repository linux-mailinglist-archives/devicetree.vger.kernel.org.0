That seems reasonable to me, I guess the "true" was entirely redundant 
there.  I don't think that makes much of a difference in the rest of the 
discussion, it's just a bit cleaner in the encoding.

Ya, it's like the GCC docs that say "this is like an ISA string, but 
different".  Good to note, but not that helpful for users.  Though I 
suppose the fact that we can never seem to document how ISA strings work 
is a pretty good sign they're not a good interface...
