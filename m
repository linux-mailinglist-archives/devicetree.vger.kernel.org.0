Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. David Mathers a bank officer with credit suisse Bank of United Kingdom. I have a business proposal to discuss with you. The business is all about transferring $30,000,000.00 to your favor for investment purposes which is the reason I am contacting with you for our own benefits. For more details, please do contact me on my private email ( davidmather.private@gmail.com )

Also kindly promise me that you will never betray me and my family after assisting us to claim this fund from the Bank.

Thank you and may God bless you!

Regards,
Mr. David Mathers.
