Will do that end of this week.

I'd really like to see that happen early in this release cycle so we
can catch bugs before those commits reach Linus' tree, and the
lvds-codec changes depend on your PR. Can we make sure this one is
merged just after the MW has closed and the drm-next -> drm-misc-next
back merge done just after that?
