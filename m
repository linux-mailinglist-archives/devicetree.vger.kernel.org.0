Subject: [PATCH v4 0/8] New Arasan NAND controller driver

Hello,

This is a deep rework of Naga's Arasan NAND controller driver. This
version is the final version and works with software ECC. It relies on
a previous series called "Supporting restricted NAND controllers" that
brings more flexibility to the NAND with the goal to support
restricted controllers like this one.

Cheers,
MiquÃ¨l

Changes in v4:
* Collected Reviewed-by tags.
* Dropped Ivan from the list (did not find his contact).
* Wrapped commit log.
* Fixed typos in the commit logs/comments.
* Took authorship of all patches.
* Added more details on the BCH changes.
* Documented the new bch_control entry.
* Made the swap bit calls conditionals in bch_encode to avoid
  penalizing people that do not use it.
* Patched bch_init() to take an extra argument.
* Dropped calls to nand_release(), use the construction proposed by
  Boris instead.
* Dropped a useless NFC struct field.
* Added a comment on not having an interrupt for RB.
* Checked the number of steps requested is compatible with the
  controller limitations.
* Reworked anfc_exec_op as suggested to treat the check_only argument
  another way.
* Change the comment stating that the controller has only one CS.
* Clarified the interrupts signals vs. interrupt status bits.

Changes in v3:
* Prefix specific clock definitions with XLNX as they do not apply for
  any other SoC and are attached to a single compatible.
* Used field getters/setters as defined in bitfield.h.
* Force casting to u32 before shifting u8 values by 8 16 or 24 bits.
* Comply with the recent core changes and select manually
  nand_monolithic_read/write_page_raw() helpers.
* Add MAINTAINER patch.
* Add a bit extraction helper in the core.
* Rename BCH functions.
* Add a swapping bit mechanism to BCH.
* Support the hardware ECC engine.

Changes in v2:
* Working ->exec_op() implementation relying on core changes.
* Dropped the ECC support for now, will be part of another series if
  this patch is accepted.
