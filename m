I noticed that graph.yaml is not enough for audio-graph.
Because audio-graph needs extra propaties for endpoint,
and your endpoint is defined under port.
Maybe can't add additonal propaties (?) for it ?

Maybe we can, but I'm not expert of Json-Schema.
It is very difficult for me to create even *standard* ones.
I will continue current style to avoid unknown error
(It always indicates me unknown error :()

Thank you for your help !!

Best regards
