So, the vote based on the requirements of cpufreq driver should come
directly from the cpufreq side itself, but no one stops the others
layers to aggregate the requests and then act on them. This is how it
is done for other frameworks like clk, regulator, genpd, etc.

You guys need to figure out who aggregates the requests from all users
or input providers for a certain path. This was pushed into the genpd
core in case of performance state for example.
