Yes, exactly. And bugs too.

Yes. Even your FPGA is tied to some implementation...

Oh good, folks are learning. :)

Is the vendor ID (and revision) discoverable even if no vendor
extensions? If so, then I'm more comfortable with "mipi-i3c-hci" on
it's own. The exception will be if there's setup needed to discover
the h/w which seems likely. In that case, we should probably do
compatible strings based on VID/PID like PCI, USB, etc. No need to
define that now I guess, but please add some sort of summary of the
above about the discoverability of the HCI implementer and features.
