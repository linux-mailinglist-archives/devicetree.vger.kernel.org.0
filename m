To address some of Srinivas's comments, I think you should actually
add the 4th range in here too:

- description: The start of the security control region.

That allows you to read 0x6000 and get the major/minor/step properly.


I will also note that as I've started reviewing the driver code it'll
probably make everyone's life easiest if you keep the "corrected"
region first, even if it's not numerically first.


I've updated my FIXUP patch again.  I might notice more comments as I
review the driver more, but we'll see...
