Ah OK, I will try that and ask for help if I am stuck as I am still trying
to learn these, not there yet ðŸ˜„

Thanks for the suggestion, I would love this to force spec authors to
stop relying on DT and add whatever needed in future to the spec as part
of discovery APIs.

I prefer if we don't, but I will run this through spec authors so that
they are aware of what we will do in DT which means they *have* to
incorporate any future needs into the spec discovery apis.

Ah I forgot the spec author is cc-ed. @Achin please shout if you see
issues with this approach.
