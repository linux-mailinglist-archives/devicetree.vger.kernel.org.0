I'll have a think about that. The other chips I'm aiming to support
(the mercury5 ssc8336 and infinity2m ssd202) currently reuse most of
the msc313 bits with a few extras for the differences.
i.e. the ssc8336 reuses most of the tables for the msc313 with some
additions. Adding new chips hasn't been too bad so far.

Ok. I was really just trying to enforce some sort of pattern there so
that each chip that gets added follows the same convention.

I did think about this and I did this with the clk mux driver I
haven't pushed yet. In that case there is a random lump of registers
with some muxes mixed into it so I decided to make the lump a syscon
and then have a node for each clk mux in the lump and some properties
for the muxes within. The driver is certainly less complex but the
device tree is pretty unmanageable as there are probably 30 or more
muxes.

The reason is that readb()/writeb() will invoke the heavy memory
barrier even though it's not needed for peripheral registers.
I guess it doesn't actually make all that much difference in reality.

Noted. I'll fix this and the readb and send a patch at some point.

This was discussed and I think Linus said it was ok.

Thanks,
