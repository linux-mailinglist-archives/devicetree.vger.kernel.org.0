The bus format stuff that was added then removed might be better suited
for what you have in mind. Right now that's put in the simple panel
driver, but it likely doesn't belong there, since the bus format is
also related to the hardware integration, signal routing as you mentioned,
and not just a property of the panel itself.

Nevertheless, what I'm looking for can be achieved using bus format
as well. Given that I have no datasheet for the panel in the device
I'm upstreaming, and only a vague part number to go with, describing
it as a bus format modifier rather than a property of the panel might
be safer.

So I'll just drop the two patches regarding bit depth for now.
