Hello My Dearest


My name is Mrs. Theresa Brown, I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to a reliable individual who will act as I will
instruct here. I am 69 years old and was diagnosed for cancer about
3years ago. I have been touched by God to donate from what I have
inherited from my late father to you for the good work of God, rather
than allow my uncle to use my father hard earned funds ungodly.

I will be undergoing an operation in London , and I pray that I
survive the operation. I have decided to WILL the sum of $7,000,000.00
USD (Seven Million United States Dollars Only) deposited in a security
company, to you for the good work of the lord, the orphanage, the
needy and to help the motherless.

Presently, I have informed my Doctor, Dr G L G 's about my
decision in WILLING this fund to a reliable individual, you are to get
back to me immediately if you are interested in carrying out this
task, so that I will instruct you on how to get in touch with my doctor.

Lastly, I know I have never meet you, but in other to fulfill this
which borders me most and I got your email address through my personal
search on the Internet, my mind tells me to inform you about this, and


I hope you act sincerely, please get back  via this Email-  tb1582999@gmail.co
m
immediately

Doctor,  Dr G L G 's  Email- GERARdOLEOPOLdOGARZA111@outlook.com

God bless you.

Mrs. Theresa Brown
