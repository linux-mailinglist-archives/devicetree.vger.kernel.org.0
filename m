My Dear Friend,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments and am sorry
to approach you through this media, it is because it serves the
fastest means of communication. I came across your E-mail from my
personal search and I decided to contact you believing you will be
honest to fulfill my final wish before I die.

I am Mrs. Elizabeth Edward, 63 years, from USA, I am childless and I
am suffering from a pro-long critical cancer, my doctors confirmed I
may not live beyond two months from now as my ill health has defiled
all forms of medical treatment.  Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve
decided, willingly to fulfill my long-time promise to donate you the
sum ($5.000.000.00) million dollars I inherited from my late husband
Mr. Edward Herbart, foreign bank account over years. I need a very
honest person who can assist in transfer of this money to his or her
account and use the funds for charities work of God while you use 50%
for yourself. I want you to know there are no risks involved; it is
100% hitch free & safe. If you
will be interesting to assist in getting this fund into your account
for charity project to fulfill my promise before I die please let me
know immediately. I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality as I
wait for your reply.

Best Regards.

Mrs. Elizabeth Edward.
