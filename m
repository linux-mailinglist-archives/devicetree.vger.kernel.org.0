Nah, seems we can just update the compatible.

I guess you could keep the old compatible there too if really needed.
But then again if the old compatible is known to be incorrect, it
should be just updated.

So it looks good to me for the dts changes. Do you want me to pick
them into fixes as it seems that the panel driver fix is a separate
issue?

Regards,

Tony
