Good day,

Am Caroline Edward, a staff general in the US Army presently serving
in Syria as a combat instructor, I sincerely apologize for intruding
into your privacy, this might come as a surprise to you, but nothing
is more distressing to me at this time as i find myself forced by
events beyond my control, i have summoned courage to contact you. I am
a 45 years old lady, am a widow and I had a son who is now 16 years of
age.

Some money in various currencies where discovered in barrels at a farm
house in the middle East during a rescue operation in Iraq War,and it
was agreed by Staff Sergeant Kenneth Buff and myself that some part of
these money be shared between both of us, I was given a total of ($5
Million US Dollars) as my own share , I kept this money in a
consignment for a long while with a security Company which i declared
and deposit as my personal effects and it has been secured and
protected for years now with the diplomatic Delivery Service.

Now, the WAR in Iraq is over, and all possible problems that could
have emanated from the shared money has been totally cleaned up and
all file closed, all what was discovered in the Middle East is no more
discussed, am now ready to retire from active services by the end of
this month, but, i need a trustworthy person that can help me take
possession of this funds and keep it safe while i work on my relief
letters to join you so that we could discuss possible business
partnership together with the money.

But I tell you what! No compensation can make up for the risk we are
taken with our lives.You can confirm the genuineness of the findings
by clicking on this web site:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2988455.stm

I=E2=80=99m seeking your kind assistance to move the sum of US$5 Million
Dollars to you as far as I can be assured that the money will be safe
in your care until I  complete my service here in (SYRIA). The most
important thing is; =E2=80=9CCan I Trust you=E2=80=9D?,As an officer on ACT=
IVE DUTY am
not allowed access to money, therefore, i have declared the content of
the consignment as personal effect that i would like to be delivered
to a friend. You will be rewarded with 30% of this funds for your
help, all that is required is your trust between us till the money
gets to you.

Sincerely,
Gen. Caroline Edward.
