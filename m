Yes, I've seen this value also.

Sorry, I'm missing the point :/

We dropped in the kernel any static power computation because as there
was no value, the resulting code was considered dead. So we rely on the
dynamic power only.

No because there is no sustainable power specified for the thermal zones
related to the GPU.
