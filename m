Okay. So the 814 phandles would result in an array with 1024 slots. That
would need 4KiB of memory.
What about we go back to the fix 64 slots array but with hash32 for the
lookup? Without the hash we would be 60ms slower during boot (compared
to now, based on ancient data) but then the hash isn't expensive so we
end up with better coverage of the memory on systems which don't have a
plain enumeration of the phandle.
