hi3660-hikey960.dts:
  Define a 'ports' node for 'adv7533: adv7533@39' and the
  'adi,dsi-lanes' property to make it compliant with the adi,adv7533 DT
  binding.

  This fills the requirements to meet the binding requirements,
  remote endpoints are not defined.

hi6220-hikey.dts:
  Change property name s/pd-gpio/pd-gpios, gpio properties should be
  plural. This is just a cosmetic change.
