I've also noticed that we have a few other omap-based platforms that
got broken, for the same reason :-( We're missing driver support for
innolux,at070tn83, samsung,lte430wq-f0c and startek,startek-kd050c, and
we have a few nodes that use panel-dpi without any more precise
compatible string.

That's tempting, as breaking DT is quite bad, but that would require
adding a match on panel-dpi, and parsing timings in the panel-simple
driver. Thierry has always been opposed to that as far as I can tell,
and even if I don't share his point of view, I don't want to move in
this direction without a consensus.

Your series is fine in my opinion, as even if we decide to handle
backward compatibility in this case, changing the DT files in mainline
is still the right way to go (if only to avoid giving wrong examples).
