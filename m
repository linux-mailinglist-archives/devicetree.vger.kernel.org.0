Welcome. :)

This would not replace libgpiod and the associated character devices but just
allowing developers to easily access some well defined input/output lines as,
for example, sensors, etc.

So, the question is: why a lot of devices can be read/written via the /sys/class
interface and gpio lines can not? :-D

This mail-list has already discussed about this interface and I whould avoid
cross-posting on mail-lists.

I see, but my idea is also to easily manage these lines.

Ciao,
