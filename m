Right, so there's no need for devices to define those properties again
as they get checked by the parent/bus schema already.

I guess what you are looking for something defining a device is SPI,
I2C, etc. There's nothing for that. I've thought about doing something
like a $bus or $parent property to define what a binding should be a
child of. The problem is how do you match the parent. It's not
consistent. Sometimes we can use the parent node name, but that's not
always followed or for i2c there can be muxes in the middle.
