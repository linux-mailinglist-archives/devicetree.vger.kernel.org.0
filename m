Noted for the future. Until now we haven't done pull requests so
having the patches go into the soc patchwork made sense but from now
on we'll send pull requests when needed to you and Olof for the ARM
specific bits. Which I don't think there will be much aside from dts
stuff.

Noted.

That makes sense.
Would it be possible for you to merge that single commit for me?
Seems like that would be easier than me creating a fixes branch for a
single commit, sending you a PR, finding out I still don't actually
know how to do PR properly.. :)
If it's a hassle I'll do the PR though.

Cheers,

Daniel
