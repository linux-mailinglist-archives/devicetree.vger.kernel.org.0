ChangeLog v2->v3:
- Rename the smb@nnnnnnnn node to bus@nnnnnnnn, on a side
  track in parallel proposed a patch to change this in all
  device trees so we get coverage as well.
- Drop an dash in front of maximum as minimum/maximum is a tuple
- Move the simple-bus reference under the SMB node with an allOf
  directive so we get the restrictions of simple-bus with the
  additions of our compatible (etc)
- Rewrite the compatible schema to use one enum and one const
  item.
- Duplicate the compatible schema for motherboard also directly
  under the smb node with the option of being "simple-bus" only
  and expand the text description so people understand what is
  going on.
- Indent the -if directive for required top-level properties
  one step (syntactically incorrect but was incidentally working)
ChangeLog v1->v2:
- Add missing platforms: VE RTSM, FVP, foundation model
- Properly define the arm,vexpress,site arm,vexpress,position
  and arm,vexpress,dcc attributes. Maybe these are not the most
  elegant bindings but they are used so we need to contain it
  properly.
- Add a patternProperty for the SMB (Static Memory Bus) which
  was only described in text in the Vexpress bindings. It is a
  "simple-bus" so just reference the existing bindings.
- Define the layout of the "motherboard" node sometimes but
  not always found below the SMB node, using two address-cells
  with one for chipselect.
- Make the arm,hbi property required on the ARMv7 variants.

+title: ARM Versatile Express and Juno Boards Device Tree Bindings

+description: |+
+  ARM's Versatile Express platform were built as reference designs for exploring
+  multicore Cortex-A class systems. The Versatile Express family contains both
+  32 bit (Aarch32) and 64 bit (Aarch64) systems.
+
+  The board consist of a motherboard and one or more daughterboards (tiles). The
+  motherboard provides a set of peripherals. Processor and RAM "live" on the
+  tiles.
+
+  The motherboard and each core tile should be described by a separate Device
+  Tree source file, with the tile's description including the motherboard file
+  using an include directive. As the motherboard can be initialized in one of
+  two different configurations ("memory maps"), care must be taken to include
+  the correct one.
+
+  When a new generation of boards were introduced under the name "Juno", these
+  shared to many common characteristics with the Versatile Express that the
+  "arm,vexpress" compatible was retained in the root node, and these are
+  included in this binding schema as well.
+
+  The root node indicates the CPU SoC on the core tile, and this
+  is a daughterboard to the main motherboard. The name used in the compatible
+  string shall match the name given in the core tile's technical reference
+  manual, followed by "arm,vexpress" as an additional compatible value. If
+  further subvariants are released of the core tile, even more fine-granular
+  compatible strings with up to three compatible strings are used.
