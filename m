I just started work with central bank of Lome Togo. and I came across your file which was marked X and your released disk  painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid VIRTUALLY all fees and but the fund was not released to you.

The most annoying thing is that they won't tell you the truth that  no account will they ever release the fund to you,instead they allow you spend money unnecessarily, I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release this fund to you if you can certify me of my security.I needed to do this because you need to know the statues of your Funds and cause for the delay,Please this is like a Mafia setting in Lome Togo, you may not understand it because you are not a Togolese.

The only thing needed to release this fund is the Anti drug/terrorist clearance certificate which will be tendered to any of your nominated bank and the INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE(IRS)for clearance of the transferred amount in your account.Once the Anti drug /terrorist clearance certificate is obtained funds will immediately reflect in your bank within 10 Minutes,the certificate is all that is needed to complete this transaction.

Note that the actual funds is valued at $5 MILLION USD and the president made a compensation fund release for all unpaid beneficiary valued at $1 million usd.Listed below are the mafia's and banks behind the non release of your funds that i managed to sneak out for your kind perusal.
