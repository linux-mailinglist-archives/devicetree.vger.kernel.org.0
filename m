kmalloc would do.

I would move this function above select_bus_fmt_recursive() to avoid
putting it in-between functions that are related to each other.

I think this needs to be clarified.

 * This helper is a pluggable implementation of the
 * &drm_bridge_funcs.atomic_get_input_bus_fmts operation for bridges that don't
 * modify the bus configuration between their input and their output. It returns
 * an array of input formats with a single element set to @output_fmt.

s/0/NULL/

and that's actually not true, you just crash if num_input_fmts == NULL
:-) That's fine as num_input_fmts can't be NULL, so just drop the last
part of the sentence.

I think this needs to be extended a little bit. I have no trouble
understanding what this structure describes, but it may be less evident
for someone who hasn't followed the development. The commit message
suffers from the same issue, perhaps even more.

How about

 * This structure stores the configuration of a physical bus between two
 * components in an output pipeline, usually between two bridges, an encoder and
 * a bridge, or a bridge and a connector.
 *
 * The bus configuration is stored in &drm_bridge_state separately for the input
 * and output buses, as seen from the point of view of each bridge. The bus
 * configuration of a bridge output is usually identical to the configuration of
 * the next bridge's input, but may differ if the signals are modified between
 * the two bridges, for instance by an inverter on the board. The input and
 * output configurations of a bridge may differ if the bridge modifies the
 * signals internally, for instance by performing format conversion, or
 * modifying signals polarities.

With this I would also simplify the description of the flags field as it
would otherwise contain redundant information.

You need either a blank line, or a reflow of the paragraph.

You need to describe what happens if the output_fmt isn't supported.
Should this return an allocated array of zero size or NULL ?

I would add "as the input format may be used to configure the CRTC
output appropriately.".

That's twice the same field, did you mean output_bus_cfg.flags for the
second one ?
