Looking at Bjorn's remoteproc tree[0], the common bindings patch is 
applied on top of other (unrelated) remoteproc patches, so merging it 
into Marc's tree is out of question unless Bjorn is willing to re-write 
his tree (probably not).

The other option would be for Marc/Thomas to add these patches into a 
'late' branch, to be sent to Linus after Bjorn's tree has been merged.
Bjorn could help by sending his pull request early and someone from TI 
can keep an eye out for when its safe to merge.

Thanks,
Sekhar
