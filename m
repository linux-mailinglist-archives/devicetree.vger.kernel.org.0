Perhaps should be display/dsi-controller.yaml now?

You're assuming a certain unit-address format when a dsi-controller
could be on any bus. So use '^dsi-controller(@.*)?$

But here we want to define the unit-address format. The address is the
virtual channel # which can be 0-3:

^panel@[0-3]$

minimum: 0
maximum: 3

'reg' should be required?
