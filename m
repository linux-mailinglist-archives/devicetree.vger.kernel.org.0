... and actually there is no point.  It is _way_ too soon to even
start thinking of using 10GKR for its true purpose - the patches
to add 10GBASER were only merged for v5.6-rc1, so we're still waiting
for a kernel with that update to be released.  In other words, there's
no stable kernels to backport it to yet.

Do we want it to go into -rc?  If so, it also needs to be thoroughly
tested.
