Sorry, you're right, of course. The register isn't in the
documentation I have but I found it referenced in some sample code. By
default it seems the device automatically stores the logical address
if it recognizes a polling message (with src == dst) that was not
ack'd. The behavior can be configured to allow explicit logical
address assignment instead. I assume that would be preferred?

Thanks,
Jeff
