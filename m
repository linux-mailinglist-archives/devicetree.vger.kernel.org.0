That's right.

Although, those rules haven't been sufficient for some cases, which
has been discussed many many times by now. I can dig out some of the
old threads from the mail archive, just tell me and will help to find
them.

For mmc we have decided to improve the situation by adding support for
aliases in DT. The support seems robust enough to me, but if you think
there are problems with it, please tell me and I am happy to help to
improve it.

In regards to adding a new Kconfig option for "legacy probe", I am
open to this if that's what people think is needed. Although, as
pointed out earlier in this thread, it won't move us into a stable
situation. The only solution to get to that point, is either to use
udev/disklabel rules or the mmc aliases in DT.

Kind regards
Uffe
