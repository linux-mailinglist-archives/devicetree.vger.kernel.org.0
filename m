as mentioned already in a reply to another patch:

Is that really the right way? Isn't that calling for the intended usage of a compatible fall-back string?
So that a machine can just ship DTBs with for instance:
	"arm,neoverse-n1-pmu", "arm,armv8-pmuv3";
and that would magically work with all older and newer kernels already, without any patch?

As it stands right now (with a single compatible), only newer kernels could use the PMU on those SoCs (ignoring tedious backports not reaching every user).

All that would be needed for that is to officially allow two compatible strings in the binding.

Cheers,
Andre.

P.S. Still thinking about dropping those compatible strings at all and using the MIDR somehow, because then also ACPI users would benefit from core specific events.
