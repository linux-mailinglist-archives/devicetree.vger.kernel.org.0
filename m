I made the pci setup to be the very last thing in the boot and
results are still the same. There are other devices that do get
their interrupts from intc.

I seemed that way to me too on the first glance. And it looks like there
are no devices using the PCI driver. I knocked off that part altogether 
and the boot log looks pretty much the same it was. Perhaps I can do
with describing the PCIe bus only.

I could make an attempt at this. Should I try to look at an existing
kirkwood based device first, say kirkwood-6281.dtsi? I didn't see
anything SoC-specific in pci-mvebu.c. All different compatibles seem
to share the same functionality.
