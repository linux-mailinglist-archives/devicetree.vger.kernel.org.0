Subject: [PATCH v3] dt-bindings: display: dw_mipi_dsi.txt: convert to yaml
Date:   Wed, 22 Apr 2020 21:00:27 +0300
Message-Id: <20200422180028.1702996-1-adrian.ratiu@collabora.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.0

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <devicetree.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

This converts the Synopsis MIPI DSI binding documentation to yaml and
should be quite straightforward. I've added a missing ref clk and also
added Philippe as maintainer b/c he's the original txt author following
the algorithm provided in Message-ID 20200420175909.GA5810@ravnborg.org.

Changes in v3:
  - Added ports property and its children which are required (Laurent)
  - Sorted required list alphabetically

Changes in v2:
  - Removed unnecessary descriptions and maxItems (Rob)
  - Changed maintainers entry / dropped Mark (Rob)
  - Added dsi-controller.yaml ref (Rob)

-Synopsys DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller
-============================================
-
-This document defines device tree properties for the Synopsys DesignWare MIPI
-DSI host controller. It doesn't constitue a device tree binding specification
-by itself but is meant to be referenced by platform-specific device tree
-bindings.
-
-When referenced from platform device tree bindings the properties defined in
-this document are defined as follows. The platform device tree bindings are
-responsible for defining whether each optional property is used or not.
-
-- reg: Memory mapped base address and length of the DesignWare MIPI DSI
-  host controller registers. (mandatory)
-
-- clocks: References to all the clocks specified in the clock-names property
-  as specified in [1]. (mandatory)
-
-- clock-names:
-  - "pclk" is the peripheral clock for either AHB and APB. (mandatory)
-  - "px_clk" is the pixel clock for the DPI/RGB input. (optional)
-
-- resets: References to all the resets specified in the reset-names property
-  as specified in [2]. (optional)
-
-- reset-names: string reset name, must be "apb" if used. (optional)
-
-- panel or bridge node: see [3]. (mandatory)
