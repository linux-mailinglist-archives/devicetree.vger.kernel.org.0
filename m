Hi,

What do you mean by NX ?
Up to now, NX has been standing for No-eXecute. That's a bit in segment 
registers on book3s/32 to forbid executing code.

Therefore, some of your text is really misleading. If NX means something 
else for you, your text must be unambiguous.

Christophe

> Changelog:
> V2:
>    - Use threaded IRQ instead of own kernel thread handler
>    - Use pswid insted of user space CSB address to find valid CRB
