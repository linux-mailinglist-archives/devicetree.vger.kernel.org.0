Convert the ADV7511/11w/13/33/35 DT bindings to json-schema. The
original binding has been split into two files: adi,adv7511.yaml for
ADV7511/11W/13 and adi,adv7533.yaml for ADV7533/35.

-Analog Devices ADV7511(W)/13/33/35 HDMI Encoders
-------------------------------------------------
-
-The ADV7511, ADV7511W, ADV7513, ADV7533 and ADV7535 are HDMI audio and video
-transmitters compatible with HDMI 1.4 and DVI 1.0. They support color space
-conversion, S/PDIF, CEC and HDCP. ADV7533/5 supports the DSI interface for input
-pixels, while the others support RGB interface.
-
-Required properties:
-
-- compatible: Should be one of:
-		"adi,adv7511"
-		"adi,adv7511w"
-		"adi,adv7513"
-		"adi,adv7533"
-		"adi,adv7535"
-
-- reg: I2C slave addresses
-  The ADV7511 internal registers are split into four pages exposed through
-  different I2C addresses, creating four register maps. Each map has it own
-  I2C address and acts as a standard slave device on the I2C bus. The main
-  address is mandatory, others are optional and revert to defaults if not
-  specified.
-
-
-The ADV7511 supports a large number of input data formats that differ by their
-color depth, color format, clock mode, bit justification and random
-arrangement of components on the data bus. The combination of the following
-properties describe the input and map directly to the video input tables of the
-ADV7511 datasheet that document all the supported combinations.
-
-- adi,input-depth: Number of bits per color component at the input (8, 10 or
-  12).
-- adi,input-colorspace: The input color space, one of "rgb", "yuv422" or
-  "yuv444".
-- adi,input-clock: The input clock type, one of "1x" (one clock cycle per
-  pixel), "2x" (two clock cycles per pixel), "ddr" (one clock cycle per pixel,
-  data driven on both edges).
-
-The following input format properties are required except in "rgb 1x" and
-"yuv444 1x" modes, in which case they must not be specified.
-
-- adi,input-style: The input components arrangement variant (1, 2 or 3), as
-  listed in the input format tables in the datasheet.
-- adi,input-justification: The input bit justification ("left", "evenly",
-  "right").
-
-- avdd-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the AVDD pin on the chip.
-- dvdd-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the DVDD pin on the chip.
-- pvdd-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the PVDD pin on the chip.
-- dvdd-3v-supply: A 3.3V supply that powers up the pin called DVDD_3V
-  on the chip.
-- bgvdd-supply: A 1.8V supply that powers up the BGVDD pin. This is
-  needed only for ADV7511.
-
-The following properties are required for ADV7533 and ADV7535:
-
-- adi,dsi-lanes: Number of DSI data lanes connected to the DSI host. It should
-  be one of 1, 2, 3 or 4.
-- a2vdd-supply: 1.8V supply that powers up the A2VDD pin on the chip.
-- v3p3-supply: A 3.3V supply that powers up the V3P3 pin on the chip.
-- v1p2-supply: A supply that powers up the V1P2 pin on the chip. It can be
-  either 1.2V or 1.8V for ADV7533 but only 1.8V for ADV7535.
-
-Optional properties:
-
-- interrupts: Specifier for the ADV7511 interrupt
-- pd-gpios: Specifier for the GPIO connected to the power down signal
-
-- adi,clock-delay: Video data clock delay relative to the pixel clock, in ps
-  (-1200 ps .. 1600 ps). Defaults to no delay.
-- adi,embedded-sync: The input uses synchronization signals embedded in the
-  data stream (similar to BT.656). Defaults to separate H/V synchronization
-  signals.
-- adi,disable-timing-generator: Only for ADV7533 and ADV7535. Disables the
-  internal timing generator. The chip will rely on the sync signals in the
-  DSI data lanes, rather than generate its own timings for HDMI output.
-- clocks: from common clock binding: reference to the CEC clock.
-- clock-names: from common clock binding: must be "cec".
-- reg-names : Names of maps with programmable addresses.
-	It can contain any map needing a non-default address.
-	Possible maps names are : "main", "edid", "cec", "packet"
-
-Required nodes:
-
-The ADV7511 has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the OF
-graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
-
-- Video port 0 for the RGB, YUV or DSI input. In the case of ADV7533/5, the
-  remote endpoint phandle should be a reference to a valid mipi_dsi_host device
-  node.
-- Video port 1 for the HDMI output
-- Audio port 2 for the HDMI audio input
-
