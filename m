The function would only be callable if TPM subsystem was enabled. That 
doesn't sound right to make kexec depend on the TPM subsystem.

I could just implement a less generic function that only handles the 
vTPM case then and not target this function to be called from the TPM 
subsystem via the refactoring in 3/3.

For some reason the TPM log of a hardware TPM I believe is written in 
little endian. I am not aware of the history of it.

 From what I know it's only vTPM with of-tree that needs this.

It only comes down to from where tpm_post_kexec() is called. The 
postcore_initcall() solves the issue this series is addressing in a more 
general way than if it's called from the TPM subsystem. If this initcall 
is unacceptable then I guess we would have to call if from the TPM 
subsystem - no other choice then.


   Thanks.
