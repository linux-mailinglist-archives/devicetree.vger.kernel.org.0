Hi Daniel,

It is not recommended to turn off LMh once enabled. From h/w point of 
view, it can be done for debug purposes but it is not to be implemented 
as a feature.

Right. Also remember that  patch 5 in this series removes the cooling 
devices for the cpu thermal zones. So if you are testing this you will 
have to add them back.

So IIUC, it refers to tsens for individual cpus and collates the input. 
But the documentation is not clear on this one. I took the mitigation 
temperature from downstream code. Yes I did realize that the thermal 
zone trip1 temp is 90 degree where as the LMh mitigation point is 95 
degree. My thinking is this is because the h/w mitigation can happen 
faster than s/w and hence the 5 degree bump up in temperature.

Thank you very much
