Personally, I'd prefer going with what is on the PCB
or defined in the schematics.

This makes it way easier finding dt-elements either in
schematics or on the board itself.

This is true for all names ;-)

On the Odroid-Go for example buttons are really named
sw1, sw2, ... so the dt-name became button-sw1 etc.

I tend to agree :-) .

That heavily depends on the bootloader. I.e. speeds should be
consistent between them.

A lot of cheaper usb-ttl adapters tend to have difficulties with the
faster speeds, so 115200 is easier for those, but you need u-boot
to also use this speed.


On the Odroid-Go I did both the u-boot and kernel parts, so could
make sure those matched.

same comment about ideally using board/schematics names.
But then again, I won't make a fuss if it's named differently :-)
