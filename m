Good Day,

Accept my apologies for writing you a surprise letter. I am Mr. Asim
Mahmood, I am a banker for Garanti Ak Finans Bank, Burkina Faso. I
hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that
I am about to impose on you. I have a very important interest that I
would like to discuss with you regarding one of our late customers who
had a fixed deposit account at our bank. I have been in search of
someone with the same last name as yours, so when I saw your name, I
was pushed to contact you for our mutual benefit.

I have the opportunity to transfer the sum of (US$ 6,300,000) to you.
I would like to invest these funds and introduce you to our bank as
the beneficiary of the deceased client for this transaction. All I
need is your sincere cooperation and I promise this will be done under
a legitimate agreement that will protect us from any violation of the
law. I agree that 40% of this money will go to you as my foreign
partner, 50% to me, while 10% will go to establish a foundation for
the underprivileged people in your country. If you would like to hear
me out, I will provide you with full details of this transaction in
your reply to this letter.

Thank you for your urgent response.

Regards,
Mr. Asim Mahmood.
