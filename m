Hi Robin,

thanks for your review. Only adressing some non-formal comments below.

Hmm, this is strange. It works fine on my unit (with the current OpenWrt release). Can you test this and report back?

To be honest, I've missed that this is still polled. I've had this set to polled mode, as I've
had some issues (were to dumb) to get the pinmux going. I'll switch this to interrupt triggered and report back.

It seems to matter, as otherwise forwards from LAN to WAN will result in tx_fifo errors.

Yup, I've forgotten that there's reset-gpio bindings for the PHY itself.

I'll test this.

You are right, I'll fix this.

I've seen reports of people having Fans on their NanoPi R2S, my unit does not have such

I'll look into this.

Thanks for this explanation, I'll remove and re-test.

Ouch, I've completely missed the micro-USB port is wired up to the OTG port.

I'll follow up with a v3 in the coming days. Thanks for your feedback!
