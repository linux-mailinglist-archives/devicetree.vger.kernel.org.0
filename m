Subject: [PATCH v3 00/20] dts/dt-bindings: Fix Arm Ltd. ARMv8 "boards"
Date:   Wed, 13 May 2020 11:29:56 +0100

A few updates compared to v2. The most important is to fix the
interrupt-maps, triggered by changing the number of address-cells in
the GIC node. For this I split the former patch 07/17 into two (09/20
and 10/20), one for the foundation model, the other for Juno.
Also I fixed a dtc complaint about device nodes without reg properties
being inside simple-bus nodes, those are the new patches 04-06/20.
Will took patch 01/17 from v2 already, so I removed this from this
series.
The rest of the patches stayed the same.
-----------------------------------

The .dts files in the arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm directory describe several
boards and platforms provided by Arm Ltd. (mostly Juno and fastmodels).
Both the .dts files and some of their associated .yaml bindings were not
fully compliant, for some boards a simple dtc run complains already.
And make dtbs_check would create quite a list of violations.

This series attempts to fix all of them, although some are not yet
covered, as they require some discussion about potential binding or
DT schema changes.

The first and the last two patches fix some minor omissions in the yaml
bindings.
The rest of the series then address the violations that dtbs_check and
dtc itself reported: many node name scheme mismatches, some missing
properties or wrong child node handling. See the respective patches for
more details.

After applying this series I still see the following warnings:
- vexpress-v2f-1xv7-ca53x2: leds: linux,default-trigger names not
  listed. The kernel provides triggers for each CPU core, which the DT
  tries to use. However cpu<x> is not listed in the binding, and I fail
  to add a regexp for a property *value* to express this easily.
  Alternatively we could drop any constraint on this string at all,
  since this might become a moving target and is not really a hardware
  property, rather than a convenience Linux configuration option.
- juno: scp-sram: The compatible names for the SCPI child nodes are not
  fully converted to yaml yet, so dtbs_check fails to find a matching
  schema. Converting the SCPI bindings over is next on my list.
- fvp-base-revc: panel: 'power-supply' is a required property
  Indeed the Linux driver depends on that property, not sure how this
  ever worked. I am about to test this, the fix should a rather easy
  addition of a fixed regulator.

Please have a look, I am open to discussions.

Cheers,
Andre

Changelog v2 ... v3:
- drop patch v2 01/17, Will took that already
- also move fixed devices for vexpress, foundation and Juno (04-06/20)
- use "arm,gic-400" in addition to the "Cortex GIC" for the models
- adjust all interrupt-map properties to reflect GIC #address-cells changes

Changelog v1 ... v2:
- drop GIC "compatible" changes for Juno
- add "arm,gic-400", "arm,cortex-a15-gic" as a valid combination
- reorder more controversial binding fixes to the end
- add Robin's Acked-by:
- fix subject lines in first three emails
