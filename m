With the patch the roots are identified as follows:

# lspci -nn -vv
0000:00:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88f5181
[Orion-1] ARM SoC [11ab:5181] (rev 03)
...
0001:01:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88f5181
[Orion-1] ARM SoC [11ab:5181] (rev 03)

Everything else remained the same.
