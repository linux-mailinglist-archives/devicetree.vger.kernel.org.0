Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] Bring GPIO CS support to the Arasan controller driver

Hello,

This is a short series bringing a useful feature for drivers which are a
little bit constrained regarding their number of native CS. As
manufacturer tend to group chips in arrays to enlarge the overall
available space, it might be useful to other controller drivers to make
use of the added DT property (cs-gpios) as well as the core helper which
is being introduced to parse this DT property and returned a CS array
with either empty cells (native CS are being used) or a GPIO descriptor
structure pointer (GPIO CS).

This is applied to the Arasan NAND controller driver which involved a
little bit more boilerplate than estimated I thought due to its internal
constraints regarding the bond between CS and RB.

Cheers,
Miqu√®l

Changes in v2:
* Added a missing MODULE_EXPORT() reported by kernel test robot.

Changes in v2:
* Rebased on top of v5.13-rc1
* This time I'm CC'ing Rob + DT ML...

  mtd: rawnand: Move struct gpio_desc declaration to the top
  mtd: rawnand: Add a helper to parse the gpio-cs DT property
  mtd: rawnand: arasan: Ensure proper configuration for the asserted
    target
  mtd: rawnand: arasan: Leverage additional GPIO CS
