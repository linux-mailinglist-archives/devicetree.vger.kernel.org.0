I'll defer to Rob to tell the law here :-)

I thought the following could work:

if:
  not:
    properties:
      adi,input-colorspace:
        enum: [ rgb, yuv444 ]
      adi,input-clock:
        items:
          - const: 1x

But no big deal, contains: is ok too.

We can decouple the two though (I think). The bindings should reflect
what we consider right, and the dts files could be fixed on top.
