Ok, now I see the problem on the tooling side and why you chose not to
use this syntax.

Good to know, this kind of puzzled me when I tried all the
configurations :)

Ok.

Well, thanks for the feedback, with the latest dt-schema the tooling
now validates the binding so I am going to send it as a v6 to collect
your Ack.

Thanks,
