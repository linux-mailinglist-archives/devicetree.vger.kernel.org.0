You are right, the Linux function regulator_dev_lookup() falls back to matching
by regulator name if no property exists in the devicetree. But again this is a
Linux-ism that we would rather not rely on.

Yes, you should add this property. The supplies are a bit more abstract than you
are expecting. Each of these pin banks (unless it is totally unused) has to get
power from _somewhere_, and that "somewhere" is the supply that should be
referenced.

There is no need for the supply to be a dedicated pin, or for the supply name to
match any pin or regulator name. For example, the LRADC needs a reference
voltage for its comparator, so it has a "vref-supply" property. But there is no
"VREF" pin. The LRADC's reference voltage is one of several things internally
connected to the SoC's "AVCC" pin.

So here, vcc-pf-supply just means abstractly "the voltage supply for Port F".

The fact that sometimes there also happens to be a pin named VCC-Px is the
result of not coming up with a second name for something that has a perfectly
good name already.

Samuel
