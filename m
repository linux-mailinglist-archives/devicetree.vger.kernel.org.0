This I2C pin muxing is getting trickier than I initially thought :-S
Naming the child buses i2c0_0 and i2c0_1 means that boards exposing I2C0
on the 40-pins GPIO headers would have different labels for that I2C0
interface depending on whether they multiplex I2C0 on other pins (e.g.
on pins 44+45 for the camera connector of the Pi 4B) or not (e.g. the Pi
400). Overlays would thus not be compatible, which I suppose would be
annoying for users.

Before I send a new version of the series, I'd like to know what
direction I should take. Is overlay compatibility between the two cases
listed above important ? If so, I can imagine at least two solutions:

- On boards that use I2C0 pinmuxing, we can rename the physical
  interface to i2c0if and name the two child buses i2c0 and i2c_csi_dsi.
  This is the solution used in the downstream kernel. It is implemented
  with a crude (in my opinion) hack though: board files have constructs
  such as

  #define i2c0 i2c0if
  #include "bcm2711.dtsi"
  #undef i2c0

- Always mux the I2C0 bus, on pins 0+1 and 28+29 or 0+1 and 44+45,
  depending on the board. Boards that don't connect anything to the I2C
  bus on pins 28+29 or 44+45 would still pick one of the two options. As
  there will be no I2C device on the second bus, the corresponding
  pinctrl entry will never be selected, so this should be harmless. The
  downside is that there will be an I2C mux instantiated in the kernel,
  adding a level of indirection to the I2C operations.

Other solutions may be possible.

What would be everybody's favourite option ?
