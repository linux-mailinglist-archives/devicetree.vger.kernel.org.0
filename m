I would just do 1).

To some extent, the warnings are for avoiding poor design on new
bindings. We need a way to distinguish between existing boards and new
ones. Maybe dts needs to learn some warning disable annotations or we
need per target warning settings (DTC_FLAGS_foo.dtb ?). Or maybe this
check is just too strict.
