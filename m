I would have expected the clock cell to contain the Resource ID.

Also, this still has one clock per node which you should avoid unless
there's only a small number of clocks (say ~20). Move this all to a
single node with the list of clock IDs in clock-indices and other
properties like power-domains can match up with clock-indices. IOW,
both should have the same length (in elements).

For the clock type, perhaps combine that in the clock cell with the
resource ID such as using the upper 8-bits.

I don't understand how these work with overlapping numbers.
