You triggered me to re-read some old thread about this.
And I think I got it now.

Based on a proposal you made some weeks ago I did it like this:
properties:
  compatible:
    description:
      Shall contain a panel specific compatible and "panel-dpi"
      in that order.
    items:
      - {}
      - const: panel-dpi

So no constraints on the panel specific compatible, expect that it is present.
And panel-dpi must be listed as the second compatible.

Updated the example too.
Will post a v3.

Thanks!

	Sam
