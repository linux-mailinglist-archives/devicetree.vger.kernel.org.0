The driver doesn't apply any setting to the device :-) The ti,deskew
property is meant to report the deskew settings selected by the chip's
configuration pins, not to set a value to be programmed to the device.

Oops. That's embarassing... It should clearly be a max(), not a min().
And only for hold_time_ps is this required.

Would you like to send a patch, or should I do so ?
