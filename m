Yeah, looks like PA17 is missing above. This pin is used for MII only, so
it is omitted from the existing gmac_rgmii_pins group.

Evgeny: Did you try a 100MBit PHY on PortA? That should work with both the
GMAC and EMAC, right? I wonder if we should add a group that connects all
pins needed for MII to the GMAC as well, so basically the above (with PA17
added), but using 'function = "gmac";'? Put an "/omit-if-no-ref/" before
that (also to those above?) to avoid blowing up the DTB needlessly.

Cheers,
Andre.
