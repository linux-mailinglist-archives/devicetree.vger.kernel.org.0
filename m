Hello Dear,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as big surprise. Actually, I came
across your E-mail from my personal search afterward I decided to
email you directly believing that you will be honest to fulfill my
final wish before i die.

Meanwhile, I am Mrs.  Nicole Martha 62 years old, from France, and I
am suffering from a long time cancer and from all indication my
condition is really deteriorating as my doctors have confirmed and
courageously advised me that I may not live beyond two months from now
for the reason that my tumor has reached a critical stage which has
defiled all forms of medical treatment. As a matter of fact,
registered nurse by profession while my husband was dealing on Gold
Dust and Gold Dory Bars till his sudden death the year 2016 then I
took over his business till date.

In fact, at this moment I have a deposit sum of four million five
hundred thousand US dollars ($4,500,000.00) with one bank but
unfortunately I cannot visit the bank since I m critically sick and
powerless to do anything myself but my bank account officer advised me
to assign any of my trustworthy relative, friends or partner with
authorization letter to stand as the recipient of my money but
sorrowfully I dont have any reliable relative and no child.

Therefore, I want you to receive the money and take 50% to take care
of yourself and family while 50% should be use basically on
humanitarian purposes mostly to orphanages home, Motherless babies
home, less privileged and disable citizens and widows around the
world. and as soon as I receive your I shall send you my pictures,
banking records and with full contacts of my banking institution to
communicate them on the matter.Please contact me with these email
address.( nicolemartha247@gmail.com)

Hope to hear from you soon.
Yours Faithfully,
Mrs.  Nicole Martha
