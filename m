Obviously.  ;-)

It is, but so far it's self-discoverable.

Yes. It's even in the very first 32-bit word from the register space. 
Here's the relevant code:

#define HCI_VERSION                     0x00    /* HCI Version (in BCD) */

[...]

        /* Validate HCI hardware version */
        regval = reg_read(HCI_VERSION);
        hci->version_major = (regval >> 8) & 0xf;
        hci->version_minor = (regval >> 4) & 0xf;
        hci->revision = regval & 0xf;
        NOTE("HCI v%u.%u r%02u",
             hci->version_major, hci->version_minor, hci->revision);
        /* known versions */
        switch (regval & ~0xf) {
        case 0x100:     /* version 1.0 */
        case 0x110:     /* version 1.1 */
        case 0x200:     /* version 2.0 */
                break;
        default:
                ERR("unsupported HCI version");
                return -EPROTONOSUPPORT;
        }

Then there is a register that provides the relative offset to another 
register area where "extended attributes" are to be found. Those 
attributes are also spec defined. One of the standard attributes 
contains the MIPI vendor ID, the vendor version ID and vendor product 
ID. And then there is a range of attributes which are vendor defined. 
That's where specific stuff like fancy clock controls would be located 
and vendor specific tweaks to be applied. But so far 
everything can be predicated on hardware-provided data.

OK.
