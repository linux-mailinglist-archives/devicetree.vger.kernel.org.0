Hi Rob

I noticed that it seems "$ref: audio-graph-port.yaml#" is not working.
For example, below is under "renesas,rcar.yaml" control which
is using "$ref: audio-graph-port.yaml#" for ports/port and endpoint.

"audio-graph-port.yaml" has "endpoint" properties,
and below are not allowed by it.
But there is no warning/error by

	make dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/renesas,rsnd.yaml 

Am I misunderstanding ?

Thank you for your help !!
