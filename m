Should this not live in userspace HAL, kernel would provide an abstract 
interface. User space in this case which is programming the bootcount is 
already aware of this, so am hoping that it would be able to encapsulate 
the magic as well with in.

Instead of accessing sysfs directly, its always recommended to access it 
via a some abstraction HAL programs, so as to not break the userspace 
across kernel releases, more info at 
./Documentation/admin-guide/sysfs-rules.rst

Other problem with having this in kernel is that we would endup with 
endless number of drivers for each nvmem cell which is totally not 
necessary.

Personally I do not want to endup in such a situation where people start 
writing drivers for each cell.

There is a good document from Greg KH,
