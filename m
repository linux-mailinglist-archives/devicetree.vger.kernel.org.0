OK we found some usecase which may require separate nodes. I am sure they
could be alternative solution even with above style of array of UUID strings.

If you remember use of SMC/HVC as SCMI transport[1], it just provides one
way(a2p) communication. P2A is not possible with that, i.e platform
notifications to OSPM is not possible. FFA aims to replace native SMC/HVC
transport there to provide bi-directional support. For such usecase,
where one partition running SCMI server might provide multiple channels
for SCMI communication and we may need to provide the link using phandle
or something in DT.

Let me know your thoughts on those.
