OK, so that sounds as if we want to go with the proposal where we
"deprecate the old driver and/or bindings and say that there really
should just be one node and one driver".

Would this be acceptable to you?

1. Officially mark the old bindings as deprecated.

2. Leave the old driver there to support the old deprecated bindings,
at least until everyone can be transferred over.  There seem to be
quite a few existing users of "qcom,qfprom" and we're supposed to make
an attempt at keeping the old device trees working, at least for a
little while.  Once everyone is transferred over we could decide to
delete the old driver.

3. We will have a totally new driver here.

4. A given device tree will _not_ be allowed to have both
"qcom,qfprom" specified and "qcom,SOC-qfprom" specified.  ...and by
"qcom,SOC-qfprom" I mean that SOC should be replaced by the SoC name,
so "qcom,sc7180-qfprom" or "qcom,sdm845-qfprom".  So once you switch
to the new node it replaces the old node.

Great.  That sounds right to me.  Presumably the driver could add some
sort of "debugfs" access to read the raw address space if needed.
