Yes, that's always the case: all default choices are arbitrary in the
Linux kernel, there is actually a lot of logic provided by the core to
handle that, unless the user requires something specific.

This means a strength of 32 bits per kilobyte of data vs 24 bits per
kilobyte.

What you call the legacy way is even better, the only situation where
it may be an issue is if the NAND chip does not feature enough OOB
bytes to store the ECC codes, which does not seem to be your primary
concern here.

What does "safety guaranteed" means?

How is this an argument? I am usually in favor of moving forward when
there is a real justification, but this does not seem the case, unless
I am understanding it all the wrong way.

You are well aware of the upstreaming process, trying to merge
something locally, making it used and then complaining because not
upstreaming it would break your customers really is your own
responsibility.

IMHO the solutions are:
- the current (mainline) default will remain the standard for
  geometries which are already widely supported
- if there are new geometries that must be supported and do not fit
  because of the "legacy" logic, then you may detect that and try
  to fallback to the "modern" way of calculating the ECC
  parameters (or even jump directly to the modern way if the geometry
  really is not currently supported officially)
- if your customers want a specific chunk size/strength when
  rebasing on top of a mainline kernel there are DT properties which do
  that anyway
- follow Sean advice: introduce a property requesting to use the
  'modern' or 'legacy' logic (with a better name than modern) but first
  check with Rob that this if valid.

Thanks,
