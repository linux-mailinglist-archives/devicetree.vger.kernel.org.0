Good, thanks, then it should be indeed in the DT.

This will happen anyway: we only *copy* DTs from the kernel tree into
the U-Boot tree, minus some minor changes (for include paths, for
instance).

Definitely, especially if the schematic says so, the DT should follow
this. Ranges are really only useful when the device attached requires
or supports this, for instance an SD card with voltage switching, or
the CPU supply. Since there is no reference to that regulator, there is
no device that could request a change, and the kernel has no clue what
to actually set it to, it just makes sure that it is in range. Where
does the range come from in the first place? Schematics or vendor
code/DT?

Quite likely. The AXP209 datasheet mentions DRAM as the typical
application, but I think it's used here for the main 3.3V I/O rail.
Many devices work with 3.0V as well, but if the schematic says 3.3V,
we should go with this. Can you check the values when running the BSP
kernel?

Well, that's one case that the driver doesn't really cover: this
regulator is always-on (by hardware) and has a fixed voltage. Which
one that is is set by the LDO1SET pin, so software has absolutely no
control over it. So any value you put in here is actually irrelevant.
However this is used to report the voltage, so we should relax the
driver code to also accept 3.3V.
What happens exactly when you put 3.3V in there? Does the whole driver
refuse to load, with an error message? Then I am tempted to put 1.3V in,
plus a comment about the problem.
If this is just a warning or non-fatal massage, we should use 3.3V.

And push for a driver fix in both cases.

3.0V sounds about right for a PLL supply, so yes: please use
min = max = 3.0V.

Where is this pin connected to, in the USB-C connector? One of the CC
pins?

Do you mean both CC pins? IIRC this means it's hardwired as a
peripheral (UFP).

If I ignore the ID pin above, this looks like on the OrangePi Zero2 or
the MangoPi MQ-R. In those cases we put peripheral in the DT, as this
is what this connection seems to indicate. That *can* be used a host as
well, with the "right" cable, but it's not really a well supported
configuration, so we leave this up to people to change this locally,
should they really desire so.
