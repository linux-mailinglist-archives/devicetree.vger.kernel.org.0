There's currently no requirement that binding schema don't introduce
warnings in dts files. That should change when/if we get to a warning
free state (probably per platform/family). I don't think we're close
on any platform? (If we are, I'd like to start tracking that). It is
good to pay attention to the warnings you get though as the schema may
not be doing what you expect or the binding really doesn't match
reality.

Meaning you fix the dts files or massage the schema to match? If we
just adjust schema to match, what's the point in this effort? We
should find things wrong or ill defined.
