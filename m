Mmmh, I think that's correct for an USB micro-B socket, but this is a
USB type C one. I don't think USB type C role switching can be easily
implemented with just a single GPIO, probably not even with two purely
digital GPIOs, as you would need some more clever voltage detection
circuitry.
For a simple connection via a USB-2.0 A<->C cable this probably doesn't
matter (as nothing happens to the CC pins?), and a USB-C thumb drive
probably would work as well, but I doubt those boards can properly
detect that automatically.

Chris, can you check how many pins from the type C connector are
actually used on the board? Can you follow the traces? Does it just
pull CC1 and CC2 to GND, via a resistor? Or are those pins somehow
connected to the SoC, or even a separate USB-C controller chip? Maybe
also worth checking if the stock OS can detect hosts or devices attached
automatically.

I am not really familiar with the USB type C situation in those
simplified USB-2.0-only setups, so if anyone can shed some light on
this, I'd be grateful.

Cheers,
Andre
