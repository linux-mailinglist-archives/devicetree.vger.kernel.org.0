How many do you have? Is that DT available somewhere?

Not sure what the problem was as there's no code, but I'd guess the
array alloc and populating have to be done later (perhaps in
unflattening).

A kconfig option would still be my 3rd choice after dynamically
allocating the array or just growing the fixed array size.
