Indeed, that's the case for rza1-irqc.

Of course I had tried that before[1];

|    I also considered extracting the parsing code in of_irq_parse_raw() in a

|
|        int of_irq_parse_map(struct device_node **ipar, u32 *addrsize,
|                             u32 *intsize, const __be32 **match_array,
|                             struct of_phandle_args *out_irq);
|
|    However, that API is a bit ugly due to many output parameters
|    (of_irq_parse_raw() needs to iterate the interrupt hierarchy).
|    In addition, it's less efficient for irq-renesas-rza1.c, as the
|    interrupt-map must be parsed 8 times.

Or is there a better way?

In the mean time, drivers/irqchip/irq-ls-extirq.c has landed, which was
mimiced after irq-renesas-rza1.c.

The driver code indeed doesn't account for #address-cells, but the
binding says it must be zero anyway.
