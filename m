Not really, the partitions will get IDs assigned by Hypervisor or Secure
Partition Manager.

OK I need to explore this.

The idea must be to use the names as is from the spec.

AFAIU, we don't have notion of bL in KVM.

Again this is from the spec listed under manifests for the partitions.
This will let the KVM know to start the partition in Aarch32/64.

I don't have full knowledge on the details, will let Will comment on this.

I was wondering the same as the format from spec must be fixed, checked and
unfortunately it is not üôÅ.
