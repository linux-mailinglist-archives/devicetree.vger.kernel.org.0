Right, I only considered the encoder case here. For the decoder case, we
don't need a bus-width prop yet, as the bus format output is currently
enforced by the bus format input of the next component in the chain
(panel/next-bridge), but that might change if we start dealing with
panel/bridges supporting several input formats and expecting the LVDS
encoder/decoder to select one. What we do need for the decoder case
though, is a data-mapping prop, otherwise this LVDS bridge exposes a
FIXED in-format and the previous element in the chain has to use its
'default' output format (which might not be appropriate).

Maybe we should go for Sam's approach and expose a data-mapping prop
on both ends of the bridge (that implies describing RGB/DPI bus width
using the data-mapping prop), this way we wouldn't have to distinguish
the encoder/decoder case.

It's the number of lanes routed on the board. I'll clarify that.

You mean default number of lanes (24)? Well, I guess defining it
explicitly is not a bad thing, so, even if the default is already 24,
I don't see a problem setting bus-width = <24>. Actually, maybe that's
even better if we force new users to explicitly define the number of
lanes exposed on the DPI interface, but we definitely need this default
value if we want to keep things backward compatible. Not sure how to
express that (it's not mandatory, it's not optional, it's recommended
:-)).

I can do that too.
