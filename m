Yes this part is not solved, but is seems the assumption the DSI controller
can switch to HS to LS & then to HS back after a command while in video mode
isn't true in the Allwinner's case. As I understood it's one of the problems.

We're hitting a limit of the DSI controller model in Linux where we cannot
express all the DSI capabilities (Video mode, Command mode, dynamic framerate
switching, DSC, ...) since from the Panel or Bridge PoV we're blind and
we do not know what are the features supported by the DSI controller and
we lack knowledge of any operation mode we must try to achieve.
