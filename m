Well, I left it there intentionally as the code is still actively being 
developed, so full debugging can quickly be reactivated by anyone.
I can remove it if deemed too distracting.

That depends. Judgement is needed for BUG() usage.

Here raw is absolutely impossible with v1 hardware and if ever this 
happens this is definitely a software bug that needs fixing right away. 
There is no point returning a runtime error code in that case as the 
upper layer won't know what to do about it.

On the other hand, you absolutely don't want to BUG() on a condition 
that could _eventually_ happen at run time during normal usage. But 
that's not the case here.

Well... unfortunately for Boris, this is overwhelmingly prevalent in the 
kernel code:

$ git grep "^"$'\t'"\.[^ ]*"$'\t'"*= "

And I do like it.  ;-P

True. Will fix.

Again, hardware bringup from different vendors and other developments 
are still ongoing. I'd wish for those to stay for the time being unless 
people feel strongly enough about these to become a merge show stopper.

I think in this case this is really crossing the distraction threshold. 
This is used to extract debugging traces out of a specific FPGA 
implementation and is of no use to anyone else. I'll just rip that out 
from the next submission.

Fair enough. The HCI spec refers to these as "physical memory" hence the 
suffix. What were you told to use instead?

Again, if this ever happens, you're screwed. That means potential DMA 
engines could still be alive and about to scribble over memory that is 
about to be freed which may cause all sorts of impossible-to-find bugs 
in unrelated parts of the kernel. There is no point going on reporting 
such error condition to upper layers until the software, or possibly the 
hardware, is fixed

Hmmm... let's see:

According to Documentation/process/changes.rst the current minimal 
required gcc version is 4.9.

The oldest gcc I have lying around is 4.5.1 and it supports anonymous 
unions just fine.

So I think we're clear.
