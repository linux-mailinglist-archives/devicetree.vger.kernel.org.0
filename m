I see, thanks for clarifying.

When this kind of dependy happens, we have a couple of options.

1. Wait for a new rc to have the dependent changes included.
2. Share the changes between maintainers's git trees, through
immutable branches.

Looks like 1) would be easiest here. So, I suggest you re-post the
series when v5.9-rc1 is out.

No, that doesn't sound right.
