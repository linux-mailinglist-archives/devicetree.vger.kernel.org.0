I didn't look at Jitao's proposal but it looks like it's addressing a
similar issue on the DSI slave/device side: the device probably needs
to be powered before the host can interact with it through the DSI+DPHY
bus. I'm not entirely sure why we'd need another hook to do that since
we already have the ->prepare() one.
