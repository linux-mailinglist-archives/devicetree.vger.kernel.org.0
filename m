From what I've seen so far, my current thought on this issue is that
it's up to Ulf as the MMC maintainer what the next steps are.  For me,
at least, his argument that MMC block numbers have already shuffled
around several times in the last several years is at least some
evidence that they weren't exactly stable to begin with.  While we
could go back to the numbers that happened to be chosen as of kernel
v5.9, if someone was updating from a much older kernel then they may
have different expectations of what numbers are good / bad I think.

I will also offer one possible suggestion: what about a KConfig option
here?  In theory we could add a KConfig option like
"CONFIG_MMC_LEGACY_PROBE" or something that.  One can argue about what
the default ought to be, but maybe that would satisfy folks?  If you
were happy giving up a little bit of boot speed to get the v5.9 block
numbers then you could set this.
