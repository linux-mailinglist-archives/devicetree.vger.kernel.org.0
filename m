Dear Sir,

My name is Barrister David Rohm, Attorney to Engr. Kewal Pajpul, an
Indian National who was a gold merchant based in Accra hana in West
Africa. On the 19th of January, 2012, my client traveled to Kano State
in Nigeria West Africa to seal up a contract deal with a Mining firm
based in Kano State, but unfortunately he was killed by the
coordinated bombing and gun attacks in Kano by the Boko Haram Sect an
Islamic religious sect in Nigeria,  in which over 100 people were
killed, on the 20th January 2012, see Nation Newspaper of 21st January
2012 or this website
http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/21/us-nigeria-blast-id
USTRE80J1WO20120121 for details. Before his death, he deposited the
sum of $45M US dollars with a bank in Ghana meant for the purchase of
a gold field in Ghana which I am fully aware of as his attorney. Since
his death, the business could not continue which made me to demand
back the fund from the bank but I was asked to present the next of kin
to the deceased.

All effort made to get the relatives of the deceased proved abortive
hence I have to seek your assistance to stand as the next of kin to my
client, on condition that I and you will share the fund on the
modalities as may be agreed by both of us once it is transferred into
your bank account.

I have all the necessary documents to back up this claim.

I hope to invest in your country after a successful transaction.

Await your urgent response.

Thanks.
