Yes, that's true, it works either way right now.
Originally I was under the impression that the purpose of
interrupt-names was to allow any order of interrupts, but according to
Rob this is just to support optional IRQs (so having a shorter list).
The bindings require a certain order, and the dt-schema validation
complains if that differs in the DT.

Cheers,
Andre
