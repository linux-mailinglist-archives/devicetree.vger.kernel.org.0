How about using dynamic printk instead? I'm pretty sure you don't need
to debug I3C stuff early enough to warrant usage of DDEBUG.

Well, people have tried to eradicate BUG() occurrences, so let's not add
new ones if we can avoid it. How about a WARN_ON()+error:

	if (WARN_ON(raw))
		return -EINVAL;

The rational being this preference is that sooner or later someone will
add a field to hci_cmd_ops that messes up your nice formatting :P.
Anyway, that's definitely not a blocker.

Can't we replace that by a dev_dbg() using the %*pE formater?

Maybe _dma instead of _phys?

Again, I think adding a WARN_ON() and letting hci_dma_dequeue_xfer()
return an error code is a good compromise.

We had problems with a buggy version of gcc 4.<something> at some
point, and that was only when initializing anonymous unions, but I
think it's all behind us now.
