More on that topic: I checked the exynos dts we have in mainline and
no one is making use of the ports part of the exynos_dsim bindings, so
maybe we should just deprecate it. The other option would be to patch
the driver to act as a real bridge, but I can't do that without someone
testing my changes and I didn't get much feedback from Exynos
maintainers so far...
