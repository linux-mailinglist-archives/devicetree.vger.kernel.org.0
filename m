FWIW my understanding is that the "soc" node is used to provide a 'bus' 
to represent on-chip MMIO - in principle we could nerd out and describe 
the ACE-lite/AXI/APB slave interconnects in full, but there's really no 
benefit to going into that much detail - so everything with a "reg" 
representing a physical address goes inside it, while CPUs, clocks, 
firmware, regulators etc. sit in the root node 'outside the PA space', 
regardless of whether they're physically on-chip or not.
