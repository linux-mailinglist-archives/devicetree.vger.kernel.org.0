Subject: [PATCH 19/25] ARM: dts: sun9i: Switch A80 dts(i) to use SPDX identifier
Date:   Wed,  3 Jul 2019 18:16:03 +0530
Message-Id: <20190703124609.21435-20-jagan@amarulasolutions.com>

Adopt the SPDX license identifier headers to ease license
compliance management on Allwinner A80 dts(i) files.

While the text specifies "of the GPL or the X11 license"
but the actual license text matches the MIT license as
specified at [0]
