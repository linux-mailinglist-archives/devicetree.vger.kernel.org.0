A separate driver wouldn't make too much of a difference. Thierry's
point was that drivers should hardcode the timings, as the compatible
string gives enough information and encoding timings in DT would
duplicate that information. I have a different point of view, and there
are pros and cons for both options, so we haven't been able to reach an
agreement. That's why I haven't pushed too hard for timings parsing from
DT, regardless of whether it would be in panel-simple or in a separate
driver.
