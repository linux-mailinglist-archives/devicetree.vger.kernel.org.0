Agreed on all the comments, so have just removed those context.

I assume it would be OP-TEE indicating it would like to use 32-bit.
I am thinking of API from the driver would be like:

int (*32bit_mode_only_set)(struct ffa_device *dev);

Let me know if that works for you. FF-A driver has no other way to evaluate
that and I really don't like that in DT ðŸ˜‰
