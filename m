Please note that you will need corresponding bridge operations in order
to implement the DRM panel bridge.

The fundamental issue is that the enable/disable sequence requirements
are inherently driven by sinks, while the bridge API goes from source to
sink. A DSI panel could for instance require the following enable
sequence.

0. DSI bus disabled (LP-00 state)
1. Power up the panel
2. Enable the DSI bus (LP-11 state)
3. Configure the panel (through DCS LP mode writes, SPI, GPIOs, ...)
4. Transition the source to HS mode, sending sync packets, but no data
5. Perform additional configuration for the panel
6. Enable transmission of video from the source

For a given bus type there are thus well-specified states for a source
(in this case disabled, enabled in LP mode, in HS mode, sending sync
packets, sending video packets).

As our API operates from source to sink, fine-grained control of bridges
is difficult. We can of course always make bridge and panel operations
more fine-grained, but that's more of a ad-hoc solution that may lead to
abuse. We would at the very least document very explicitly what each
operation would be allowed to do for every bus type.
