Hello, Business Cooperation

My name is Mr. Adams Robinson, an Investment Attorney with a reputable
legal & investment management firm. My Firm mostly represents the
interests of wealthy investors.

Due to the sensitivity of the position they hold in their society and
the unstable investment environment of their country, some of our
Clients evacuate majority of their funds into more stable economies
and developed nations where they can get good yield for their money.

A Reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with a few years ago
with a proposal, recently approached me. What he request is an
individual such as you, who will be willing to receive money on his
behalf, and put it to good use for a period not exceeding 6 years for
a start.

The Client has offered some terms which will be discussed when you
show interest and make appointment for meeting to know more and
understanding,

Reply to this mail at infooffice508@gmail.com
	
Sincerely,	
Mr. Adams J. Robinson
