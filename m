Yes, that should be worked. I can't exactly figure out how to refactor
the code for now, but maybe parsed endpoint descriptors are being
checked with default hard wired bInterval value and after that
an overridden value should be checked again.

Actually I don't care about the details of software policies. I just want
all devices to be handled in the same manner without any further
special treatments.

The hub hardware has a default bInterval inside which is actually
adjustable. So I can think setting bInterval is to describe the hardware
rather than policy.

Changing the interval at runtime is an another way to solve the
power consumption problem, but it's not so easy. At least xhci needs
to restart an endpoint and no devices are changing the interval after
enumeration stage.

Thanks!
