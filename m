I'm not sure why you put quotes around those names.

You can the drop the "One can also imagine ..." since it's more than a
theoretical use case, we already have a few engines that fall in this
category.

But I think I would simply drop this last sentence.

Again, I would drop the last sentence here. I think saying the ECC
bytes are generated/data corrected on the fly when a page is
written/read would be more useful.

"The on-die correction can be enabled, disabled" -> this is true for
any kind of ECC engine :P.

How about "Enable/disable the ECC engine based on the I/O request type."

This is also true for external hardware ECC engines.

It's all about correcting/reporting errors, right. Let's try to put
that into simple words: "Correct the data in case of a read request and
report the number of corrected bits/uncorrectable errors. Most likely
empty for write operations, unless you have hardware specific stuff to
do, like shutting down the engine to save some power"

"The I/O request should be enclosed in a prepare()/finish() pair of
calls" or "The prepare/finish call should surround the I/O request".

Mention that those are just examples, and drivers are free to add
custom steps in their prepare/finish hooks.

Shouldn't we have kernel-docs for those functions?
